AB  - Non-point source (NPS) pollution is an important factor affecting the quality of water environment. In recent years, a large number of online water quality monitoring stations have been used to obtain continuous time series water quality monitoring data. These data provide the necessary basis for the application of deep learning methods in water quality prediction. However, the prediction accuracy of traditional deep learning methods is low, especially in predicting the water quality with NPS pollution. Aiming to address this limitation, a novel deep learning model named SOD-VGG-LSTM with the simulation-observation difference (SOD) modular based on physical process, the visual geometry (VGG) modular reflecting spatial characteristics, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) modular based on deep learning method was developed to improve the accuracy of the water quality prediction with NPS pollution. The established model can overcome the problem that mechanism models can not predict the changes of water quality on the hourly or minute time scale. The model was applied in Lijiang River watershed. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model had the highest accuracy in the extreme value prediction compared with the mechanism model and LSTM model. The maximum relative errors between the predicted and observed results for DO, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP were 8.47%, 19.76%, 24.1%, and 35.4%, respectively. The model evaluation demonstrated thatthe established SOD-VGG-LSTM model achieved superior computational performance compared to Auto Regression Integreate Moving Average model (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression model (SVR), and Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN). The evaluation results showed that SOD-VGG-LSTM achieved 3.2–39.3% higher R2 than ARIMA, SVR and RNN. The proposed model can provide a new method for water quality prediction with NPS pollution.

AB  - Monthly streamflow time series are highly non-linear. How to improve forecast accuracy is a great challenge in hydrological studies. A lot of research has been conducted to address the streamflow forecasting problem, however, few methods are developed to make a systematic research. The objective of this study is to understand the underlying trend of streamflow so that a regression model can be developed to forecast the flow volume. In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast. The average error of the proposed model is reduced to less than one-tenth in contrast to the state-of-the-art method and the standard deviation is also reduced by more than 30%, which implies a greater consistency.

AB  - Flood prediction in ungauged catchments is usually conducted by hydrological models that are parameterized based on nearby and similar gauged catchments. As an alternative to this process-based modelling, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated their ability for prediction in ungauged catchments (PUB) with high efficiency. Catchment characteristics, the number of gauged catchments, and their level of hydroclimatic heterogeneity in the training dataset used for model regionalization can directly affect the model’s performance. Here, we study the generalization ability of a DL model to these factors by applying an Encoder-Decoder Long Short-Term Memory neural network for a 6-hour lead-time runoff prediction in 35 mountainous catchments in China. By varying the available number of catchments and model settings with different training datasets, namely local, regional, and PUB models, we evaluated the generalization ability of our model. We found that both quantity (i.e. number of gauged catchments available) and heterogeneity of the training dataset used for the DL model are important for improving model performance in the PUB context, due to a data synergy effect. The assessment of the sensitivity to catchment characteristics showed that the model performance is mainly correlated to the local hydro-climatic conditions; the more arid the region, the more likely it is to have a poor model performance for prediction in ungauged catchments. The results suggest that the regional ED-LSTM model is a promising method to predict streamflow from rainfall inputs in PUB, and outline the need for preparing a representative training dataset.

Among these applications, visualization and visual analytics, also known as the visual computing techniques, empower the synergy of computational methods (e.g., machine learning and statistical models) with human reasoning to improve the understanding and solution toward complex science and engineering problems. These approaches are frequently integrated with geographic information systems and cyberinfrastructure to provide new opportunities and methods for enhancing water resources management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent hydroinformatics applications that employ visual computing techniques to (1) support complex data-driven research problems, and (2) support the communication and decision-makings in the water resources management sector. Then, we conduct a technical review of the state-of-the-art web-based visualization technologies and libraries to share our experiences on developing shareable, adaptive, and interactive visualizations and visual interfaces for water resources management applications.

AB  - As history shows, a linear production process results in a waste of resources. Using renewable energy can not only reduce waste but also protect the earth's resources. However, due to the high input costs of biogas manufacturing and a lack of standard manufacturing procedures, there have been few predictive models generated using multiple algorithms to analyze key input wastes and to predict output in the field of biogas generation. The lack of key wastes analysis may result in reductions in both the optimization of production processes and the stability of production, eventually affecting the popularity of biogas generation. Therefore, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning method based on random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) analysis for redefining the key factors and improving the prediction of biogas generation output. The analysis adopted input and production output data from an existing biogas plant. Regarding the predication for biogas production, the performance of the proposed hybrid model exhibits 20% more accuracy than its nearest competitor among traditional analytic models. Coupled with the assistance of a hybrid machine learning method, the identification of key factors can be improved, providing users with suggestions and guidance for modifying parameters. Through a precise control of final output and manufacturing process, this methodology may be expected to help reduce costs and accelerate the popularity of biogas.

AB  - Carbon price is the basis of developing a low carbon economy. The accurate carbon price forecast can not only stimulate the actions of enterprises and families, but also encourage the study and development of low carbon technology. However, as the original carbon price series is non-stationary and nonlinear, traditional methods are less robust to predict it. In this study, an innovative nonlinear ensemble paradigm of improved feature extraction and deep learning algorithm is proposed for carbon price forecasting, which includes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN), sample entropy (SE), long short-term memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF). As the core of the proposed model, LSTM enhanced from the recurrent neural network is utilized to establish appropriate prediction models by extracting memory features of the long and short term. Improved feature extraction, as assistant data preprocessing, represents its unique advantage for improving calculating efficiency and accuracy. Removing irrelevant features from original time series through CEEMDAN lets learning easier and it's even better for using SE to recombine similar-complexity modes. Furthermore, compared with simple linear ensemble learning, RF increases the generalization ability for robustness to achieve the final nonlinear output results. Two markets' real data of carbon trading in china are as the experiment cases to test the effectiveness of the above model. The final simulation results indicate that the proposed model performs better than the other four benchmark methods reflected by the smaller statistical errors. Overall, the developed approach provides an effective method for predicting carbon price.

AB  - With the trend of global warming and destructive human activities, the frequent occurrences of catastrophes have posed devastating threats to human life and social stability worldwide. The emergency management (EM) system plays a significant role in saving people's lives and reducing property damage. The prediction system for the occurrence of emergency events and resulting impacts is widely recognized as the first stage of the EM system, the accuracy of which has a significant impact on the efficiency of resource allocation, dispatching, and evacuation. In fact, the number and variety of contributions to prediction techniques, such as statistic analysis, artificial intelligence, and simulation method, are exploded in recent years, motivating the need for a systematic analysis of the current works on disaster prediction. To this end, this paper presents a systematic review of contributions on prediction methods for emergency occurrence and resource demand of both natural and man-made disasters. Through a detailed discussion on the features of each type of emergency event, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art prediction technologies which have been widely applied in EM. After that, we summarize the challenges of current efforts and point out future directions.

For this purpose, twenty-year observed streamflow and suspended sediment load (SSL) data were employed in both daily and monthly scales. The proposed seasonal models have full profits of classic LSTM model in time series processing and handle sole LSTM model’s weaknesses in failing to capture seasonal information of the process which usually exist in hydro-climate time series. The proposed models enhanced the long-short autoregressive dependency of runoff-sediment data by taking into consideration of very long seasonal dependency of data. The obtained outputs indicate the outperformance of proposed seasonal LSTM models to the classic LSTM and feed forward neural network models in test step up to about 25% and 28% in daily and monthly scales, respectively.

AB  - As the solar energy develops sharply in recent years, accurate solar output forecasting is becoming one of the most important and challenging problems in modern power system. For enhancing the prediction accuracy of solar output, this research proposes an effective forecasting method using the famous compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and cooperation search algorithm (CSA). The proposed methodology is composed of three important stages: firstly, the solar output signal is divided into a set of relatively simple subcomponents with obvious frequency differences via the CEEMDAN method; secondary, the GRU model is used to individually forecast each subcomponent while the CSA method is used to optimize the GRU parameters and enhance the forecasting ability; finally, the simulation values of all constructed models are added to obtain the corresponding forecasting results. The developed model takes advantages of the data decomposition technique and advanced machine learning to identify the suitable dependence relationship and network topology structures. Extensive experiments indicate that the developed model can yield accurate forecasting results for solar outputs in comparison with several traditional forecasting methods with respect to different evaluation criteria. Thus, an effective framework combining the signal decomposition technique and evolutionary method into machine learning model is presented for solar output forecasting.

AB  - In this study, a multiscale long short-term memory model with attention mechanism (MLSTM-AM) is proposed to improve the accuracy of monthly precipitation forecasting. In the MLSTM-AM model, à trous wavelet transform (ATWT) is first employed to decompose the standardized monthly precipitation anomaly and climate indices into a certain number of subseries with different time scales. Then at each of time scales, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model is constructed to predict the precipitation anomaly subseries by coupling with partial information (PI) algorithm for selecting the model inputs and attention mechanism (AM) for optimizing the model structure. Finally, all the predicted subseries are summed, and then the summed series is transformed as the monthly precipitation prediction. The proposed MLSTM-AM model is examined with 129 stations over the Yangtze River basin and compared with the MLSTM, LSTM and multiple linear regression (MLR). The MLSTM is formed by coupling the LSTM with the ATWT. For comparison, the inputs of all the models are identified by the PI algorithm. Results show that the prediction of all the models is more skillful in the western region than in the eastern region of the basin, which is strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation. The LSTM outperforms the MLR in terms of two performance evaluation indicators at most of stations. The MLSTM and MLSTM-AM improve monthly precipitation forecasts at all of 129 stations over the basin compared to the LSTM, and the MLSTM-AM provides the best prediction performance among all these models.

This study proposes a novel matrix-based deep learning approach for predicting spatial distribution of water depths in rivers. The proposed approach was constructed based on a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN) with a new architecture that was specifically designed for providing spatial distribution maps. A numerical dataset was established based on a field cruise and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling for different scenarios, and numerical experiments were designed to predict spatial distribution of water depths for different scenarios using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), and the proposed CNN algorithms. The results showed that the proposed CNN approach captured both the large-scale and small-scale spatial patterns remarkably well, and it outperformed the other approaches. This study shows that the 2D CNN algorithm is better than the classical machine learning (ML) algorithms for inundation modeling. The proposed approach is thus a promising tool for providing rapid predictions of spatial distribution of water depths in river systems and can potentially be leveraged to predict other spatially distributed hydrological variables.

AB  - Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear spatiotemporal prediction problem. However, few studies have considered the spatial characteristics of rainfall-runoff relationship in runoff forecasts based on machine learning. With the emergence of high-resolution Satellite-based Precipitation Products (SPPs) and the continuous improvement of rainfall estimation accuracy, the shortcoming of sparse spatial information for in-situ rainfall monitoring has been made up. Therefore, this study developed a large scale spatiotemporal deep learning rainfall-runoff (SDLRR) forecasting model for hydrological stations in the upper Yangtze River, and evaluated the positive impact of utilizing spatial information of three SPPs on reducing errors of runoff forecasts. The adopted remote sensing precipitation products are bias-corrected Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement data (IMERG) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis data (TMPA). For runoff forecasting at the Luoduxi (LDX) hydrological station, compared to regular Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) model, the proposed SDLRR model that utilizing IMERG data as precipitation input (IMERG_SDLRR) improved 15% in terms of Coefficient of Determination (R2) and improved 25% in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compared to the best performance model among models using area-averaged precipitation as input, IMERG_SDLRR improved 5% in terms of R2 and 11% in terms of RMSE. Good performance was also acquired in the other hydrological stations. For extreme flood forecasts, IMERG_SDLRR decreased Mean Relative Error (MRE) by 0.29 and increased Qualified Rate (QR) by 53% compared to LSTM, and decreased MRE by 0.08 and increased QR by 6% compared to the best performance model using area-averaged precipitation as input. The utilization of IMERG or TMPA spatial information improved the accuracy of runoff forecasting. The accuracy evaluation of SPPs based on the results of spatiotemporal rainfall-runoff forecasts method was also demonstrated. The research is of great significance for developing runoff forecasting methods and optimizing water resources management.

AB  - A flood is one of the most hazardous natural disasters, and it commonly causes fatalities and socioeconomic damages. The advances of modeling techniques and observation data in flood prediction have found success in field operations. This paper presents a comprehensive flood prediction of Hurricane Harvey in 1-hour lead-time that is not limited to 1D streamflow forecast but also 2D flood extent and 3D inundation depth. It uses high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs, from operational Rapid Refresh-RAP, and High Resolution Rapid Refresh-HRRR models) and deep learning nowcasts (AI nowcasts). The results show that the QPFs have a well-known displacement issue and the AI nowcast cannot predict the precipitation intensity, and an attempt to combine the two methods (AI hybrid) failed to improve the overall accuracy. However, the 2D flood extent predictions with the HRRR and AI hybrid forcings can provide information indicating the future flooded area with about 50% accuracy (hit rate) and stream flow prediction showed that the HRRR QPF can provide relatively accurate flood peak prediction (-8%). In contrast, the AI nowcast reveals minimal displacement errors but underpredicts precipitation intensity. The deep learning method also indicates that the binary tests with low threshold, which are commonly employed in the deep learning field, neglect the importance of precipitation intensity errors for extreme event studies.

However, due to the complexity during flood formation, the accuracy of traditional flood forecasting models suffer from the performance degradation with the increasing of required prediction period. According to the mutual information(MI) analysis to practical hydrologic data of Xixian Basin from year 2011–2018 in China, this paper proposes a long-term cyclic hydrology prediction model with the help of an improved Long Short-Term Memory. Firstly, by flitering, classifying and MI analysis the original data, the hydrological features, e.g., rainfall, reservoir water-level and flow are extracted as the time series features of the long short-term memory cyclic(LSTMC) forecasting model. Next, the structure of the LSTMC model is trained and determined by modeling the rainfall process to reflect the long-term change of flood flow. Finally, the actual flood data is used to verify the output of our model. Compared with some traditional and machine-learning flood forecasting schemes, it can be demonstrated that our model can accurately complete the task of long and short lead time hydrology forecasting.

AB  - The frequency and severity of floods have noticeably increased worldwide in the last decades due to climate change and urbanization. This study aims to build an urban flood warning system for reducing the impact of flood disasters. A great number of storm-induced rainfall data were collected in Taipei, Taiwan, and the corresponding 2-D inundation maps were simulated for illustrating urban rainfall-flood inundation processes. We proposed a novel urban flood forecast methodology framed by machine learning and statistical techniques to mine the spatial–temporal features between rainfall patterns and inundation maps for making multi-step-ahead regional flood inundation forecasts. The proposed methodology (PCA-SOM-NARX) integrated the advantages of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). PCA was used to extract principal components representing the different spatial distributions of urban inundation. SOM was used to cluster high dimensional inundation datasets to form a two-dimensional topological feature map. NARX was used to establish multi-step-ahead flood forecast models for the next hour at a 10-minute scale. The results show that the PCA-SOM-NARX approach not only produced more stable and accurate multi-step-ahead forecasts on flood inundation depth but was also more indicative of the spatial distribution of inundation caused by torrential rain events, compared to the SOM-NARX approach (the benchmark). The results demonstrate the proposed methodology can adequately grasp the inundation status associated with different rainfall distributions to reliably and accurately forecast regional flood inundation depths, which can help decision makers respond to flooding earlier and mitigate flood disasters.

AB  - There has been a strong tendency in recent decades to develop real-time urban flood prediction models for early warning to the public due to a large number of worldwide urban flood occurrences and their disastrous consequences. While a significant breakthrough has been made so far, there are still some potential knowledge gaps that need further investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art and future trends of real-time modelling of flood forecasting in urban drainage systems. Findings showed that the combination of various real-time sources of rainfall measurement and the inclusion of other real-time data such as soil moisture, wind flow patterns, evaporation, fluvial flow and infiltration should be more investigated in real-time flood forecasting models. Additionally, artificial intelligence is also present in most of the new RTFF models in UDS and consequently further developments of this technique are expected to appear in future works.

AB  - The nature of streamflow in the basins is stochastic and complex making it difficult to make an accurate prediction about the future river flows. Recently, artificial neural-based deep learning models with a nonlinear structure have become predominant in water engineering forecasting problems such as river flow predictions. In this study, we investigate the potential of Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and attribute selection pre-processing approaches with the neural network methods in predicting monthly river streamflows in the Nallihan stream, Turkey. Antecedent measured streamflow, precipitation, relative humidity and temperature data between the years 1996 and 2016 from the observing stations in the basin boundaries were used as model inputs under different scenarios using the correlations between the past measured variables, to predict one-step-ahead flow data. To compare the newer hybrid model performances; evaluation metrics including coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NE), Willmott’s Index of Agreement (WI), root mean square error, mean absolute error together with judicious plots; scatter plot, time series and the Taylor diagrams were utilized. The developed hybrid SSA-based models registered higher accuracy than other standalone Neural Networks models without pre-processing approaches. The R2 for SSA-based models were higher ranging from 0.8300 to 0.9105, and the largest R2 = 0.9105 was registered by the proposed SSA-ANN model. SSA-ANN models have also the highest NE and WI index values: 0.9045 and 0.9764, respectively. The outcomes revealed that based on NE, the SSA decomposition increased the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy by 24.11%, 18.40% and 5.11% of respective ANN, CNN and LSTM methods. The SSA pre-processing approach is able to unveil the embedded streamflow characteristics and could be further applied in basins with similar characteristics to attain more accurate predictions of river flows.

AB  - Neurocomputing methods have contributed significantly to the advancement of modelling techniques in surface water hydrology and hydraulics in the last couple of decades, primarily due to their vast performance advantages and usage amenity. This comprehensive review considers the research progress in the past two decades, the current state-of-the-art, and future prospects of the application of neurocomputing to different aspects of hydrological sciences, i.e., quantitative surface hydrology and hydraulics. An extensive literature survey, by running over more than 800 peer-reviewed papers, outlines and concisely explores the past and recent tendencies in the application of conventional neural-based approaches and modern neurocomputing models in relevant topics of hydrological and hydraulic sciences. Apart from segregated descriptions and analyses of the main facets of surface hydrology and hydraulics, this review offers a practical summary of prevailing neurocomputing methods used in different subfields of hydrology and water engineering. Six relevant topics to modelling hydrological and hydraulic sciences are articulated and analysed, including modelling of water level in surface water bodies, flood and risk assessment, sediment transport in river systems, urban water demand prediction, modelling flow through hydro-structures, and hydraulics of sewers. This review is meant to be a mainstream guideline for researchers and practitioners whose work is associated with data mining and machine learning methods in various areas of water engineering and hydrological sciences to assist them to decide on suitable methods, network structures and modelling strategies for a given problem.

KW  - Hurricane rainfall forecasting
KW  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
KW  - GPM IMERG, early Run
AB  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques are powerful tools, which can be applied to forecast spatial imagery in sequence. In this study, we applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the next few hours of rainfall observation imagery from NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement mission and its IMERG Early Run product in assist of hurricane predictions over the U.S.-Mexico Gulf coastal region. The IMERG Early Run is a satellite-based rainfall retrieval technique, providing rainfall measurement with a half-hourly temporal resolution, near-global scale coverage, and 4 h observation latency rainfall intensity imagery. The goal of this study is to extend the observation latency so that the IMERG Early Run product could potentially be used for real-time hurricane prediction and flash flood warning. In this study, we first build a sub-dataset from the IMERG Early Run product containing total 37 past hurricane events that hit the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) bordering the Gulf of Mexico from 2002 to 2019. Then, two CNN models with different model structures are built and tested to forecast the 37 hurricane events in a retrospective manner. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to select the optimal hyperparameters of the two CNN models, i.e., the number of convolution layers, filter size, minibatch size, number of filters, and pooling size. The prediction results show that the two employed CNN models generally provide satisfactory performance, showing averaged Accuracy in the categorical metrics is above 90% and averaged NSE in the continuous metrics is above 0.5. We found that the forecasting performance of the two CNN models is not significantly different; however, the CNN model without pooling layers always shows slightly better performance than the CNN model with pooling layers. We also found that both CNN models can predict the spatial range of hurricane rainfall well, but there are limitations to underestimate in larger rainfall rates. This study will serve as a novel investigation on how AI/ML models could help with real-time hurricane predictions, and provide a future reference for selecting the optimal CNN model parameters for processing spatial rainfall data.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) or particle pollution include the tiny particles of dust and fly ash particles are expelled from coal-burning power plants. Coal combustion is an extremely prevalent source of air pollution, and resulting PM has substantial impacts on human health, especially in industrial zones. This paper aims to design a novel hybrid deep learning framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) integrated with a two-stage data filtering technique to accurately predict the air quality indices (i.e., PM2.5 and PM10) in a chosen study region ‘Miles Airport, Queensland,’ that meets the needs of the coal seam gas industry in Australia. The data used to construct the novel hybrid two-stage data filtering technique based on LSTM comprising of six meteorological parameters (i.e., wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and rainfall) and two environmental factors (i.e., ozone and total suspended particulate). In the first stage, two robust feature selection methods, namely, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the classification and regression tree (CART) approach, were adopted to explore the most significant predictors. Then in the second stage, the best subset regression (BSR) technique is utilized to determine the best subsets input combinations i.e., C1, C2, and C3 based on several particular metrics. The three BSR-based input combinations were employed in the LSTM model to estimate the PM2.5 and PM10. Furthermore, to validate the main hybrid framework, two advanced machine learning (ML) methods (i.e., LightGBM and ridge kernel regression (KRR)) and two traditional ML methods (i.e., Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP)) were hybridized with the multi-level data filtering strategy by examining the optimal input combinations. Several statistical metrics, graphical tools, and diagnostic analyses evaluated the hybrid models. The outcomes of the PM2.5 simulation based on 2375 data samples showed that the LSTM-C3 containing all the selected predictors yielded the most promising accuracy, followed by the LightGBM-C3 and MLP-C3 models. On the other hand, the simulation of PM10 distribution demonstrated that the LSTM-C3 was superior to other models, followed by the KRR-C3 and LightGBM-C3 models.

AB  - Flood forecasting is an essential non-engineering measure for flood prevention and disaster reduction. Many models have been developed to study the complex and highly random rainfall-runoff process. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), have attempted to construct rainfall-runoff models. The more advanced deep learning methods of long short-term memory (LSTM) network have been proved to better predict hydrological time series. However, the selection of LSTM hyperparameters in the past mostly relied on the experience of the staff, which often led to failure to achieve the best performance. The aim of this study is to develop a method to improve flood forecast accuracy and lead time. A deep learning neural network model based on LSTM networks and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper. The PSO algorithm was used to optimize the LSTM hyperparameter to improve the ability to learn data sequence features. The model focuses on the Jingle Watershed in the Fenhe River and the Lushi Watershed in the Luohe River and was used to predict flood processes using rainfall and runoff observation data from stations in the watersheds. We evaluated the performance of the model with the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and bias. The results show that the PSO-LSTM model outperforms the M-EIES, ANN, PSO-ANN, and LSTM at all stations in the watersheds. The PSO-LSTM model improves the flood forecasting accuracy at different lead times, especially for those exceeding 6 h, and has higher prediction accuracy and stability. The PSO-LSTM model could be used to improve accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications.

AB  - Floods result in substantial damage throughout the world every year. Accurate predictions of floods can significantly alleviate casualties and property losses. However, due to the complexity of hydrology process especially in a city with complicated pipe network, the accuracy of traditional flood forecasting models suffer from the performance degradation with the increasing of required prediction period. In the work, based on the collected historical data of Xixian City, Henan Province, China, using the Internet of Things system (IoT) in 2011-2018, a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) multi-step flood prediction model with attention mechanism is proposed. In our model, the attention mechanism is used to automatically adjust the matching degree between the input features and output. Besides, we use a bidirectional GRU model, which can process the input sequence from two directions of time series (chronologically and antichronologically), then merge their representations together. Compared with the prediction model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), our method can generate better prediction result, as can be seen from the arrival time error and peak error of floods during multi-step predictions.

Models based on the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework were recently introduced into the field of rainfall-runoff modeling. In this paper, we demonstrate a new design of a seq2seq model which shows higher prediction accuracy than previous seq2seq models. Our new design takes advantage of the high linear correlation between historical runoff and future runoff, and processes the runoff input through a linear layer. Our new seq2seq model, named seq2seq-lrp (linear runoff processing), is combined with the attention mechanism (seq2seq-lrp-a), and compared with three seq2seq benchmark models (seq2seq-1, seq2seq-2, and seq2seq-3). The five models (seq2seq-lrp, seq2seq-lrp-a, seq2seq-1, seq2seq-2, seq2seq-3) were used to simulate runoff in the Yutan sub-catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly runoff and rainfall measurements from 2000 to 2014. The results show that the novel seq2seq-lrp and seq2seq-lrp-a models are better suited in hourly flood prediction than the seq2seq benchmark models and the seq2seq-lrp-a model performs best among the five models.

AB  - In hydroelectric plants, the responsibility for the operation of the reservoirs typically lies with the national system operator, who controls the level of the reservoirs based on a stochastic problem for the economy of the potential energy available in the reservoir. However, in an emergency, the responsibility for the operation and control of the reservoir becomes the plant’s management. To have a faster decision-making process, it is important to have a forecast of water affluence in relation to the turbine capacity and use of the spillway. With the objective of evaluating the forecast increase in the level of the reservoir of a hydroelectric plant, this paper compares the use of the bagging, boosting, random subspace, bagging plus random subspace, and stacked generalization ensemble learning models to analyze this problem. The case study is based on data from a 690 MW hydroelectric plant, which has a 94 km reservoir and a 185 m high dam. The random subspace and stacking models had the best results for lower error, with a low time required for convergence in relation to the other models. The ensemble models resulted in greater accuracy for the assessed problem than long short-term memory.

AB  - Most of the two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic/hydrodynamic models are still computationally too demanding for real-time applications. In this paper, an innovative modelling approach based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) method is presented for rapid prediction of fluvial flood inundation. The CNN model is trained using outputs from a 2D hydraulic model (i.e. LISFLOOD-FP) to predict water depths. The pre-trained model is then applied to simulate the January 2005 and December 2015 floods in Carlisle, UK. The CNN predictions are compared favourably with the outputs produced by LISFLOOD-FP. The performance of the CNN model is further confirmed by benchmarking against a support vector regression (SVR) method. The results show that the CNN model outperforms SVR by a large margin. The CNN model is highly accurate in capturing flooded cells as indicated by several quantitative assessment matrices. The estimated error for reproducing maximum flood depth is 0–0.2 m for the 2005 event and 0–0.5 m for the 2015 event at over 99% of the cells covering the computational domain. The proposed CNN method offers great potential for real-time flood modelling/forecasting considering its simplicity, superior performance and computational efficiency.

AB  - Deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies, environments and societies. They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.

AB  - This study proposes a method for improving the capability of rainfall and flood forecasts by generating ensemble precipitation predictions (EPPs) associated with radar-based rainfall prediction by considering spatial rainfall errors. The EPPs are generated as a kind of Monte-Carlo simulation based on the performance of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model in the previous time step window. The generated EPPs continue to be blended with radar-based rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts that perform better than each system could perform individually. The hybrid forecasts are then adjusted by reducing the spatial rainfall errors, which have considerable contributions to the accuracy of the flood forecasts. To validate the performance of the proposed method, this method was applied to improve the capability of the coupled Local Data Assimilation and Prediction system (LDAPS) and Sejong University Rainfall – Runoff (SURR) model for rainfall and flood forecasts during two flood events that occurred in 2013 and 2016 in the Yeongwol watershed. EPPs were generated from the deterministic LDAPS rainfall events and were then blended with the McGill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by Lagrangian extrapolation (MAPLE) rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts. Each ensemble member of the hybrid model was then corrected before it was forced as an input for the SURR model to obtain ensemble streamflow predictions. The results showed that the capability of the coupled model was improved sustainably step by step and exhibited the best skills after applying the final step. For rainfall forecasts, the proportion correct (PC), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and Brier score (BS) were improved dramatically by 59%, 32%, 32% and 48% for flood events in 2013 and by 39%, 15%, 33% and 37% for flood events in 2016, respectively. For flood forecasting, the Nash – Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and absolute relative error in volume (AREV) were improved substantially by 63% and 24% for flood events in 2013 and by 42% and 53% for flood events in 2016, respectively. The success of this case study proved the viability of the method proposed in this study.

AB  - The operating conditions of large cascade hydropower stations are complex. Improving the water level prediction accuracy of large cascade hydropower stations is significant for flood control, shipping, irrigation, etc. A new hybrid model based on a refined deep residual shrinkage network and an optimized gated recurrent unit – long term memory network (GRU-LSTM) model is proposed for water level prediction at different time scales. First, to make the input data in the form of a feature map so the model can capture the weight characteristics of each influencing factor when the water level changes, the water level, flow rate, and hydroelectric power plant output data are constructed as high-dimensional feature inputs. To reduce the prediction error caused by downstream tributary backwater jacking, downstream tributary flow is added to the input data. At the same time, a semisoft threshold function with an adjustable function is inserted into the model to improve feature recognition accuracy, reduce deviation, and eliminate the noise of the original hydrological data. Second, an error weight correction function is used to adjust the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level so that the model can automatically adjust the weights of each influencing factor according to the evaluation results of water level prediction. In this process, the parameters of LSTM are optimized using the Archimedes optimization algorithm, and the output results of the LSTM and GRU networks are weighted to obtain a more accurate water level prediction. The proposed model achieves good accuracy and efficiency in downstream water level prediction of the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, outperforms existing hydrodynamic and artificial intelligence methods, and has robust scalability in flood forecasting and urban rainwater forecasting.

AB  - An escalation in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters is observed over the last decade, forcing the community to develop innovative technological solutions to reduce disaster impact. The multidisciplinary nature of disaster management suggests the collaboration between different disciplines for an efficient outcome; however, any such collaborative framework is found lacking in the literature. A common taxonomy and interpretation of disaster management related constraints are critical to develop efficient technological solutions. This article proposes a process-driven and need-oriented framework to facilitate the review of technology based contributions in disaster management. The proposed framework aims to bring technological contributions and disaster management activities in a single frame to better classify and analyse the literature. A systematic review of benchmark disruptive technology based contributions to disaster management has been performed using the proposed framework. Furthermore, a set of basic requirements and constraints at each phase of a disaster management process have been proposed and cited literature has been analysed to highlight corresponding trends. Finally, the scope of computer vision in disaster management is explored and potential activities where computer vision can be used in the future are highlighted.

AB  - Many Flood Warning Systems (FWS) have been developed to date to reduce flood risk and properly manage this natural disaster. This study presents a novel method to create an FWS based on anomaly detection in remote sensing climate data from western Lorestan, Iran, from 2001-to 2019. To this end, the monthly time series of climate products related to floods (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, soil and air temperatures, vegetation, snow, and evapotranspiration) were first processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, three algorithms – Median-Interquartile range (M−IQR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – were applied to detect anomalies in the time series of each parameter. Finally, a rule-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was designed to estimate the potential of floods per month by establishing the relationship between the observed anomalies and the occurrence of floods. The results of the proposed Fuzzy-based Flood Warning System (FFWS) using all three anomaly detection methods accurately showed the very high potential for floods in March and April 2019 (i.e., actual flood events). Two other floods occurred in October 2015 and April 2016 were also considered for further evaluation of the proposed method. The results indicated that the RNN method achieved the highest performance in flood forecasting with the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 93.85% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the potential of floods at the beginning of 2019 (i.e., January and February) was also high, although not to the extent as in March and April, indicating that the proposed method correctly identified the potential of flooding in later months and can thus provide a warning to help mitigate the impact of flood damage.

AB  - Laser shock peening (LSP) is one of the main anti-fatigue technologies in high-end manufacturing industries. However, guaranteeing its quality consistency is difficult due to its process complexity. Acoustic emission (AE) is a promising solution to accurately monitoring the surface quality of LSP, although, the large scale of monitoring data is still challenging for industrial applications. This paper studied the in-situ evaluation of surface residual compressive stress (SRCS) for 7075 aluminum alloy in LSP and the efficient sensing of AE based on deep learning methods. Firstly, a monitoring system of LSP with four types of AE sensors was developed in order to simultaneously acquire both the ultra-high and ultra-low amplitude of shock wave. The performance of those sensors is further quantitatively evaluated via long-short term memory (LSTM). Then, a new spatio-temporal parallel CNN-LSTM model for SRCS classification was proposed and experimentally validated to outperform CNN and LSTM after parameters optimization. Finally, aiming to efficient sensing of AE, the importance of different frames of AE signal was analyzed by means of the proposed dual circulation LSTM (DC-LSTM) model, which can accurately locate the key frame of time series signal. Besides, the effects of different frames of AE on classification performance was discussed. It was found that the broadband AE sensor without attenuator shows the highest classification accuracy, while the fast decay stage of AE signal has more contribution to the SRCS classification. This paper provides guidance for real-time non-destructive evaluation of residual stress via AE in laser manufacturing.

AB  - Short-term precipitation forecasting is essential for planning of human activities in multiple scales, ranging from individuals’ planning, urban management to flood prevention. Yet the short-term atmospheric dynamics are highly nonlinear that it cannot be easily captured with classical time series models. On the other hand, deep learning models are good at learning nonlinear interactions, but they are not designed to deal with the seasonality in time series. In this study, we aim to develop a forecasting model that can both handle the nonlinearities and detect the seasonality hidden within the daily precipitation data. To this end, we propose a seasonally-integrated autoencoder (SSAE) consisting of two long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders: one for learning short-term dynamics, and the other for learning the seasonality in the time series. Our experimental results show that not only does the SSAE outperform various time series models regardless of the climate type, but it also has low output variance compared to other deep learning models. The results also show that the seasonal component of the SSAE helped improve the correlation between the forecast and the actual values from 4% at horizon 1 to 37% at horizon 3.

AB  - Accurate and timely short-term forecasting services of precipitation variable are significant for people's lives and property security. The data-driven approaches demonstrate promising performance in the extrapolation of precipitation. In this paper, we proposed a spatiotemporal prediction model, namely the Spatial Temporal Long Short-Term Memory based on the self-attentive mechanism (ST-LSTM-SA). This model enables better aggregation of sequence features inspired by proposed improvements. The encapsulated 3D convolution is developed to fully exploit the short-term spatiotemporal information, and the channel correlation is modeled by self-attention mechanism to further improve representations in the long-term interaction, the effectiveness of which is validated in the ablation study. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the radar echo sequence, we successfully predicted future radar reflectivity images for next 3 h with data for previous three hours as inputs in Wuhan, China. Three machine learning methods: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning model—ConvLSTM have been chosen as comparative groups to corroborate the nowcasting availability of this model for radar echo extrapolation. Moreover, the supplementary experiment on minute dataset also illustrated the superiority of ST-LSTM-SA. The studies analyzed the forecasting performance in terms of image quality and rainfall error. The experimental results demonstrated the better versatility and performance of ST-LSTM-SA. These conclusions and attempts may provide efficient guidance for precipitation nowcasting in urban areas.

AB  - Information and communication technologies combined with in-situ sensors are increasingly being used in the management of urban drainage systems. The large amount of data collected in these systems can be used to train a data-driven soft sensor, which can supplement the physical sensor. Artificial Neural Networks have long been used for time series forecasting given their ability to recognize patterns in the data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are equipped with memory gates to help them learn time dependencies in a data series and have been proven to outperform other type of networks in predicting water levels in urban drainage systems. When used for soft sensing, neural networks typically receive antecedent observations as input, as these are good predictors of the current value. However, the antecedent observations may be missing due to transmission errors or deemed anomalous due to errors that are not easily explained. This study quantifies and compares the predictive accuracy of LSTM networks in scenarios of limited or missing antecedent observations. We applied these scenarios to an 11-month observation series from a combined sewer overflow chamber in Copenhagen, Denmark. We observed that i) LSTM predictions generally displayed large variability across training runs, which may be reduced by improving the selection of hyperparameters (non-trainable parameters); ii) when the most recent observations were known, adding information on the past did not improve the prediction accuracy; iii) when gaps were introduced in the antecedent water depth observations, LSTM networks were capable of compensating for the missing information with the other available input features (time of the day and rainfall intensity); iv) LSTM networks trained without antecedent water depth observations yielded larger prediction errors, but still comparable with other scenarios and captured both dry and wet weather behaviors. Therefore, we concluded that LSTM neural network may be trained to act as soft sensors in urban drainage systems even when observations from the physical sensors are missing.

AB  - Flooding has been a major causative aimed at social and also economic losses, and also human life’s loss. Flood flow’s accurate forecasting is a vital necessity to decrement the flooding’s risk and is essential to plan and manage the water resources systems, however, due to water flood stage analysis that is an intricate dynamic procedure characterized by temporal and spatial differences it remains to be quite challenging. Aimed at overcoming the challenge, the work has proposed a two-mode operation i.e. Data Visualization (DV) and Data Analysis (DA) for forecasting flood aimed at maintaining an accurate prediction. The main motive of the proposed framework is to forecast the flood in location wise by using the location features. Initially, DV is processed, which is initiated with the data’s quality enhancement for decrementing the error. In aid to fully utilize the database with important data, this work has initiated feature extraction (FE), and thereafter, the features are clustered into a group aimed at evading data misallocation utilizing the levy flight K-means clustering (LF-K-Means Clustering) technique. The clustered data’s visualization is executed utilizing Gaussian Kernel-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interface System (GK-ANFIS). After that, DA is executed and is initiated with data’s preprocessing followed by flood forecasting (FF) utilizing Conjugate gradient deep neural network (CGDNN) centred on K-Fold cross-validation train test split. Experiential outcomes exhibited that the framework proposed yielded 96.66% prediction accuracy and outshined the existent top-notch method.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring, agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals (approximately 25–55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications. In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the Wide & Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer SM product (L3_SM_P). In this method, horizontally and vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv, respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST), topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the SMAP SM (L3_SM_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km. Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715. The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to 0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations.

AB  - Hydrodynamic models are commonly used to understand flood risk and inform flood management decisions. However, their high computational cost can impose practical limits on real-time flood forecasting and uncertainty analysis which require fast modelling response or many model runs. Emulation models have the potential to reduce simulation times while still maintaining acceptable accuracy of the estimates. In this study, we propose an artificial neural networks (ANNs) based emulation modelling framework for flood inundation modelling. We investigate the suitability of ANNs as flood inundation models using a river segment in Queensland, Australia. Our results show that ANNs can model the time series behaviour of flood inundation and significantly reduce the simulation times required, which facilitates their use in applications requiring fast model response or a large number of model runs. Based the model development process and results, the major challenges and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Reliable and accurate regional multistep-ahead flood forecasts during extreme events are crucial and beneficial to flood disaster management and preparedness. Hydrologic uncertainty associated with the nonlinear dependence structure of flood inundation dynamics makes flood inundation forecasting fundamentally challenging. This study proposes a novel machine learning-based model (SAE-RNN) that hybrids the stacked autoencoder (SAE) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for providing accurate and timely information to support emergency management in areas impacted by flood hazards. The proposed SAE-RNN model uses SAE to compress (encode) the high-dimensional flood inundation depths in a wide region into a low-dimensional latent space representation (flood features), uses RNN to forecast multistep-ahead flood features based on regional rainfall patterns, and finally uses SAE to reconstruct (decode) the multistep-ahead forecasts of flood features into regional flood inundation depths. A large number of hourly datasets of flood inundation depths collected in Yilan County of Taiwan formed the case study, where each dataset contains 169,797 grids of inundation depth. The datasets were divided into three independent datasets for use in training, validating and testing stages. The models’ results showed that RMSE values were very small (<0.09 m) and R2 values were high (>0.95) in all the cases (1- up to 3-hour-ahead forecasts in three stages). We conclude that the reason why the proposed SAE-RNN models are capable of attaining favorable regional multistep-ahead flood inundation forecasts could be owing to two core strategies: the effective continual extraction of the nonlinear dependence structure from flood inundation dynamics for lessening hydrologic uncertainty by virtue of SAE; and the nonlinear conversion of rainfall sequences into future flood features by virtue of RNN.

AB  - The Climate change trains regularly some phenomena threatening directly the environment and the humanity. In this context, meteorology plays a more important role in the control of these phenomena. It is thus important to search resources allowing to contribute to the improvement of the numerical model for the predictions of weather and climate. The objective of this work is to look for the weaknesses of the models in the simulation of exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. These exchanges are quantified by sensible and latent heat fluxes. The preprocessing is done through the combined use of k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model in order to estimate missing values. The processing is performed with the learning of the association rules and the knowledge extracted enables us to make some comparisons between observations and simulations by the numerical model. The postprocessing is made by logical and graphical reasoning that facilitates the visualization of links between the obtained rules. This method is deployed on a database containing measured variables (sensible and latent heat flux, temperature and humidity of the air, wind speed and direction, rain, global radiation, etc.) at the experimental site of the Centre de Recherches Atmosphériques (CRA) which is one of the two sites composing the Pyrenean Plateforme for the Observation of the Atmosphere (P2OA) in France. The obtained and expressed results in the form of association rules have made it possible to highlight that the differences between model and observations from a surface flux point of view are often concomitant with an important difference on global radiation. The expected profits are relative to the generation of knowledge useful for the improvement in the quality of the prediction with a better analysis of the important concomitant factors during errors on a weather model.

The Poyang Lake watershed is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. It has been hit by frequent floods in past few decades.
Study focus
Lake-reservoir groups (LRG) are important in extreme hydrologic event mitigation in watersheds. This study used runoff-weighted model to quantify the influence of LRG on the flood mitigation in Poyang Lake based on weekly observations of GF-1 and Sentinel-1.
New hydrological insights for the region
The weekly water storage volume of LRG in the Poyang Lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing (April-September) first and then decreasing (October-March) from 2016 to 2020. The runoff-weighted model has a better effect on the calculation of detained flood volume and residence time of retained flood. The average annual total detained flood volume of LRG were 4.39 × 108 m3, 5.06 × 108 m3, 1.64 × 108 m3, 0.54 × 108 m3, and 0.15 × 108 m3 in the Xiushui, Ganjiang, Fuhe, Xinjiang, and Raohe basins, respectively, among which Xiushui and Ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention. The residence time of retained flood by LRG in the five basins are long during the dry season (October to March) but short during the wet season (April to September), and they are generally longer than those in the natural state with no reservoir. The delay days of the LRG to flood peaks were about 12, 7, 13, 22, and 26 d for each basin, respectively.

AB  - Runoff forecasting is an important approach for flood mitigation. Many machine learning models have been proposed for runoff forecasting in recent years. To reconstruct the time series of runoff data into a standard machine learning dataset, a sliding window method is usually used to pre-process the data, with the size of the window as a variable parameter which is commonly referred to as the time step. Conventional machine learning methods, such as artificial neural network models (ANN), require optimization of the time step because both too small and too large time steps reduce prediction accuracy. In this work two popular variants of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were employed to develop new data-driven flood forecasting models. GRU and LSTM models are in theory able to filter redundant information automatically, and therefore a large time step is expected to not reduce prediction accuracy. The three models (LSTM, GRU, and ANN) were applied to simulate runoff in the Yutan station control catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly discharge measurements of one runoff station and hourly rainfall of four rainfall stations from 2000 to 2014. Results show that the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models increases with increasing time step, and eventually stabilizes. This allows selection of a relatively large time step in practical runoff prediction without first evaluating and optimizing the time step required by conventional machine learning models. We also show that LSTM and GRU models perform better than ANN models when the time step is optimized. GRU models have fewer parameters and less complicated structures compared to LSTM models, and our results show that GRU models perform equally well as LSTM models. GRU may be the preferred method in short term runoff predictions since it requires less time for model training.

AB  - Data-driven models have been widely developed and achieved impressive results in streamflow prediction. However, the existing data-driven models mostly focus on the selection of input features and the adjustment of model structure, and less on the impact of spatial connectivity on daily streamflow prediction. In this paper, a basin network based on graph-structured data is constructed by considering the spatial connectivity of different stations in the real basin. Furthermore, a novel graph neural network model, variational Bayesian edge-conditioned graph convolution model, which consists of edge-conditioned convolution networks and variational Bayesian inference, is proposed to assess the spatial connectivity effects on daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed graph neural network model is applied to forecast the next-day streamflow of a hydrological station in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Six comparative models and three comparative experimental groups are used to validate model performance. The results show that the proposed model has excellent performance in terms of deterministic prediction accuracy (NSE ≈ 0.980, RMSE≈1362.7 and MAE ≈ 745.8) and probabilistic prediction reliability (ICPC≈0.984 and CRPS≈574.1), which demonstrates that establishing appropriate connectivity and reasonably identifying connection relationships in the basin network can effectively improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecasting performance of the graph convolutional model.

AB  - Runoff prediction is of great significance to flood defense. However, due to the complexity and randomness of the runoff process, it is hard to predict daily runoff accurately, especially for peak runoff. To address this issue, this study proposes an enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model for runoff prediction, where novel loss functions are introduced and feature extractors are integrated. Two loss functions (peak error tanh (PET), peak error swish (PES)) are designed to strengthen the importance of the peak runoff's prediction while weakening the weight of the normal runoff's prediction. The feature extractor consisting of three LSTM networks is established for each meteorological station, aiming to extract temporal features of the input data at each station. Taking the upper Huai River Basin in China as a case study, daily runoff from 1960–2016 is predicted using the enhanced LSTM model. Results indicate that the enhanced LSTM model performed well, achieving Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient ranging from 0.917–0.924 during the validation period (November 2005–December 2016), outperforming the widely used lumped hydrological models (Australian Water Balance Model (AWBM), Sacramento, SimHyd and Tank Model) and the data-driven models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and gated recurrent units (GRU)). The enhanced LSTM with PES as loss function performed best on extreme runoff prediction with a mean NSE for floods of 0.873. In addition, precipitation at a meteorological station with a higher altitude contributes more runoff prediction than the closest stations. This study provides an effective tool for daily runoff prediction, which will benefit the basin's flood defense and water security management.

AB  - Rainfall forecasting has gained utmost research relevance in recent times due to its complexities and persistent applications such as flood forecasting and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels, among others. Existing models use complex statistical models that are often too costly, both computationally and budgetary, or are not applied to downstream applications. Therefore, approaches that use Machine Learning algorithms in conjunction with time-series data are being explored as an alternative to overcome these drawbacks. To this end, this study presents a comparative analysis using simplified rainfall estimation models based on conventional Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures that are efficient for these downstream applications. Models based on LSTM, Stacked-LSTM, Bidirectional-LSTM Networks, XGBoost, and an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Support Vector Regression, and an Extra-trees Regressor were compared in the task of forecasting hourly rainfall volumes using time-series data. Climate data from 2000 to 2020 from five major cities in the United Kingdom were used. The evaluation metrics of Loss, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error were used to evaluate the models’ performance. Results show that a Bidirectional-LSTM Network can be used as a rainfall forecast model with comparable performance to Stacked-LSTM Networks. Among all the models tested, the Stacked-LSTM Network with two hidden layers and the Bidirectional-LSTM Network performed best. This suggests that models based on LSTM-Networks with fewer hidden layers perform better for this approach; denoting its ability to be applied as an approach for budget-wise rainfall forecast applications.

AB  - Machine-learning algorithms have shown promise for streamflow forecasts, reservoir operations, and scheduling, but have exhibited lower accuracy in predicting extended time horizons for reservoir inflows. Newer deep learning algorithms exhibited improved inflow forecasting accuracy, but existing research has been mostly limited to real-time operation and short-term planning. We propose a new multi-step forecasting approach to improve long-term forecasting accuracy for both water supply and inflow volumes. This approach uses historical snow water equivalent (SWE) and reservoir inflow time-series data to train an Encoder-Decoder algorithm to predict the reservoir inflow of future time-steps during the April-July runoff period. The optimal model and hyperparameters are selected through five-fold time-series cross validation for variations between long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder algorithms. We evaluated each algorithm using 30 years of reservoir inflow and SWE data at the Upper Stillwater Reservoir located in Utah. The optimal model was an LSTM Encoder-Decoder algorithm with 16 nodes per layer. Using this algorithm, we investigate the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy for long-term water supply, relative to a process-based Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) model as a baseline and simpler statistical methods traditionally used in forecasting (SARIMA, VAR, TBATS). Long-term water supply forecasts of the optimal deep learning algorithm proved superior to statistical methods and rivaled those of the ESP 50% exceedance probability forecast (i.e. the most probable forecast) evaluated over five consecutive hold-out periods.

AB  - With the advancement of water conservancy informatization based on Internet of Things (IoT), the hydrological data are increasingly enriched. As a result, more and more algorithms and methods relying on deep learning are introduced in the flood forecasting. Considering the ability of deep learning on complex features extraction, we proposed a flood process forecasting model based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with two-dimension (2D) convolutional operation. At first, we imported the rainfall spatial–temporal features by gridding the Xixian basin. After that, we processed the data from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as the geographical feature and employed the historical streamflow process of Xixian basin as the trend feature. Next, extensive experiments were implemented to determine the optimal hyper-parameters of the proposed CNN flood process forecasting model. Numerical results show that our proposed model demonstrated a better accuracy for predicting the flood peak and arrival occasion, with a 24-hour and 36-hour lead time respectively.

AB  - Accurate runoff prediction is critical for various fields of hydrology, agriculture, and environmental studies. Numerous hydrologic models have been developed and demonstrate good performances in runoff simulation. However, errors are inherent in forecasted runoff predictions, which can cause uncertainty in real-time flood warning systems. In order to improve the predictive performance of hydrologic modeling, this study used a deep learning approach as a post-processor to correct for errors associated with hydrologic data. The proposed model uses the long short-term memory model with sequence-to-sequence structure as a post-processor to improve runoff forecasting. Specifically, the deep learning approach was used to estimate errors in forecasted hourly runoff provided from National Water Model in Russian River basin, California, United States. Error prediction in hourly runoff with lead times between 1 and 18 h were developed using observed precipitation and errors from upstream stream gages to improve the predictive performance of National Water Model. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using numerous statistical metrics, and results show that the long short-term memory model with sequence-to-sequence post-processor improved runoff predictions compared to standalone results from the National Water Model. Statistical values of percent bias decreased from a range of −60%–80% to −15%–10% when the post-processor model was used, and similarly root mean square errors of runoff prediction decreased from 120 cms to 20 cms. Thus, this study demonstrates the power of deep learning model to improve hydrologic modeling results, especially those with short forecasting lead times.

AB  - Multivariate time series forecasting is widely used in a variety of fields, such as cyber-physical systems and financial market analysis. Recently, attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been paid attention by scholars for its ability to reduce the accumulative errors. Although attention-based RNNs are proved effective, there are still some challenges: 1) the noise in raw data will hurt model performance, 2) the traditional attentions are easy to discard low-weight input vectors, thereby leading to poor accuracy, and 3) encoder-focused attentions are not conducive to maintaining the trend consistency between the prediction and the original sequence. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Information-aware Attention Dynamic Synergy Network (IADSN), which contains a specially designed information-aware long short-term memory network (IALSTM), a multi-dimensional attention (MA) that fine-grainedly assigns weight to your attention, and an attention dynamic synergy strategy. The novelty of MA lies in assigning a weight vector to the input instead of a single scalar. Therefore, it can identify the importance of each dimension of the input vector, thus alleviating the problem of ignoring low-weight inputs. IALSTM employs internal MA and a gated fusion unit to weaken the influence of input untrusted features on prediction. The attention dynamic synergy strategy maintains the similarity between the predicted and the original series by establishing an association among the current decoder unit, the previous decoder units, and the encoder. Experiments on three fields of energy, air quality, and ecological datasets demonstrate that IADSN not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance, but also effectively maintains the dynamic tendency of the forecast series.

Because of the uncertainty and nonlinearity of flood, existing hydrological solutions always achieve low prediction robustness while machine learning (ML) approaches neglect the physical interpretability of models. In this paper, we focus on the need for flood forecasting and propose an interpretable Spatio-Temporal Attention Long Short Term Memory model (STA-LSTM) based on LSTM and attention mechanism. We use dynamic attention mechanism and LSTM to build model, Max-Min method to normalize data, variable control method to select hyperparameters, and Adam algorithm to train the model. Emphasis is placed on the visualization and interpretation of attention weights. Experiment results on three small and medium basins in China suggest that the proposed STA-LSTM model outperforms Historical Average (HA), Fully Connected Network (FCN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), original LSTM (LSTM), spatial attention LSTM (SA-LSTM), and temporal attention LSTM (TA-LSTM) in most cases. Visualization and interpretation of spatial and temporal attention weights reflect the reasonability of the proposed attention-based model.

AB  - Urban waterlogging often causes urban disasters, and the rapid early warning and comprehensive analysis of the urban waterlogging can help disaster defenses. However, the warning of waterlogging through the monitoring data cannot give grid distribution and the forecast of hydrological models cannot ensure rapid early warning. To obtain a grid rapid early warning result for a region, like an urban area, a method needs to be proposed which can meet the above problems. In this research, AutoML (automatic machine learning based on genetic algorithm) was recommended to construct the rapid early warning and comprehensive analysis models for urban waterlogging by compared with the other three machine learning algorithms, CatBoost (Categorical Boosting), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), and BPDNN (Back Propagation Deep Learning Neural Network). In the models, the forecast and historical precipitation obtained from the Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive analysis system (INCA), the difference of elevation, and the urban waterlogging risk maps provided by Tianjin Meteorological Administration were employed as the input sources. The input precipitation duration was determined as 12 h based on the sensitivity analysis of the influence of various precipitation duration on waterlogging depths. Due to the non-digital (discrete dataset) features, the urban waterlogging risk maps were transformed to the weight of each corresponding risk level according to the area of each risk level and the number of samples falling in each risk level. The difference of elevation was characterized by the average elevations of various distances from the points of concern. The output waterlogging depths were compared with the waterlogging depths monitored in Tianjin, China, whose quality was controlled by eliminating the records of the waterlogging depths lasting for a long time after the end of rainfall. The comparison of the models constructed by different methods demonstrated that the AutoML performed better (NSE and R2 > 0.92, CC > 0.95, RMSE1.1–1.9 cm) than the other three models. The forecast waterlogging depths by AutoML was also coherent with the monitoring waterlogging depths (NSE and R2 ≥ 0.9, CC ≥ 0.95, RMSE 1.7–2.2 cm). For that local topography and waterlogging risk are considered, the AutoML models can be used in the area without the monitoring of water level, quickly predict waterlogging depths and give spatial grid results for rapidly early warning.

AB  - In recent years, deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been applied to predict daily runoff, as its wonderful ability of dealing with the high nonlinear interactions among the complex hydrology factors. However, most of the existing studies focused on the model structure and the computational load, without considering the impact from the selection of multiple input variables on the model prediction. This article presents a study to evaluate this influence and provides a method of identifying the best meteorological input variables for a run off model. Rainfall data and multiple meteorological data have been considered as input to the model. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied to the data as a contrast, to reduce dimensionality and redundancy within this input data. Two different deep RNN models, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, were comparatively applied to predict runoff with these inputs. In this study, the Muskegon river and the Pearl river were taken as examples. The results demonstrate that the selection of input variables have a great influence on the predictions made using the RNN while the RNN model with multiple meteorological input data is shown to achieve higher accuracy than rainfall data alone. PCA method can improve the accuracy of deep RNN model effectively as it can reflect core information by classifying the original data information into several comprehensive variables.

AB  - Recent intensification in climate change have resulted in the rise of hydrological extreme events. This demands modeling of hydrological processes at high temporal resolution to better understand flow patterns in catchments. To model surface and sub-surface flows in a catchment we utilized a physically based model called Hydrological Simulated Program-FORTRAN and two deep learning-based models. One deep learning model consisted of only one long short-term memory (simple LSTM), whereas the other model simulated processes in each hydrological response unit (HRU) by defining one separate LSTM for each HRU (HRU-based LSTM). The models use environmental time-series data and two-dimensional spatial data to predict surface and sub-surface flows at 6-minute time step simultaneously. We tested our models in a tropical humid headwater catchment in northern Lao PDR and compared their performances. Our results showed that the simple LSTM model outperformed the other models on surface runoff prediction with the lowest MSE (7.4e−5 m3 s−1), whereas HRU-based LSTM model better predicted patterns and slopes in sub-surface flow in comparison with the other models by having the smallest MSE value (3.2e−4 m3 s−1). This study demonstrated the performance of a deep learning model when simulating hydrological cycle with high temporal resolution.

Due to technological advances, computer vision plays an increasing role in flood monitoring, modeling and awareness. However, there is a lack of systemic analysis of computer vision's relative adequacy to specific needs associated with successive flood management phases. This article presents a systematic review of relevant literature and proposes a need-based evaluation of these use-cases. Finally, the article highlights future areas of research in this domain.

AB  - Deep learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, the lack of physical mechanism becomes a major limitation in using machine learning methods that rely on the available labeled observations. To address this issue, the study proposes that synthetic samples are added to train the deep learning network by using three previously undiscussed physical mechanisms as follows: (1) extreme heavy rainfalls when the soil water is saturated, (2) long-duration rainless events when soil water is exhausted, and (3) the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff. A physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, shortly named PHY-LSTM, is then formulated. PHY-LSTM network is trained on 531 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, indicating that the performance is significantly improved compared to conventional LSTM. Specifically, the mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improves from 0.52 to 0.61 from the daily simulations during the testing period in local models. It is demonstrated that synthetic samples can effectively improve the simulation of flood peaks and reduce the number of negative streamflow, and strong monotonicity is still maintained even if a slight disturbance is involved in the training dataset. The proposed PHY-LSTM shows that physical mechanisms are very useful to improve efficiencies of the data-driven rainfall-runoff model.

AB  - Forecasting water level is an extremely important task as it allows to mitigate the effects of floods, reduce and prevent disasters. Physically based models often give good results but they require expensive computational time and various types of hydro-geomorphological data to develop the forecasting system. Alternatively, data driven forecasting models are usually faster and easier to build. During the past decades, statistical machine learning (ML) methods have greatly contributed to the advancement of data driven forecasting systems that provide cost-effective solutions and better performance. Meanwhile, Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the famous linear statistical models for time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that takes advantages of linear and nonlinear models. The proposed method combines statistical machine learning algorithms and ARIMA for forecasting water level. Observed water level of the Red river at the Vu Quang, Hanoi (3 hourly sampled from 2008 to 2017) and Hung Yen hydrological stations (hourly collected data from 2008 to 4/2015) are used to evaluate the performance of different methods. Experimental results on these 3 real big datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid models.

AB  - Water-level fluctuation (WLF) forecast plays an essential role in the regulations and management of the Yangtze River’s navigable rivers. Traditional methods for navigable rivers’ forecasts are often time-consuming and cost-inefficient, often requiring constant updates and are univariate in nature. This study utilized one of the Yangtze River’s navigable rivers, Nanjing navigable river, to perform forecasts employing deep learning techniques. For the first time, Nanjing navigable river’s WLF data was exploited to make multi-step univariate and multivariate time series forecasts, employing a deep learning technique, multilayer perceptron (MLP). The data consisted of 3545 days worth of WLF measurements from ten different navigable rivers and was allocated properly without data leakage into training and testing. MLP was built to take time series sequence inputs from up to ten navigable rivers on a daily basis and output fast, accurate, stable, and reliable short-term forecasts and undeviating trends for long-term forecasts. The models were also constructed in an adaptive way so they can self-update daily based on the daily measurements. The naive model was constructed as a baseline model to measure the improvement and the validity of MLP models. Univariate and multivariate adaptive models were then constructed based on the augmented data by a popular data-augmentation method, rolling windows. Hyperparameters of MLP models were optimized based on relevant testing and large scale grid-search. Both short-term and long-term forecasts showed promises of MLP model in time series forecast for navigable river water-level problems and they achieved at least 27.6% percent lower in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the baseline. Since the total time required for the trained models to produce forecasts and self-update is at most 15 min on a local quad-core Intel Core i5 10th generation (2.0 GHz) and because of the nonnegotiable performance of the models, it was concluded that MLP is a fast, cost-efficient, and accurate alternative technique for navigable rivers WLF forecasts.

AB  - Disaster management (DM) is one of the leading fields that deal with the humanitarian aspects of emergencies. The field has attracted researchers because of its ever-increasing need to find newer and more efficient ways of managing disaster situations to reduce human suffering. This paper reviews 128 articles published in various journals and conference proceedings on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a part of Deep Learning (DL), applications in DM from 2010 to 2021. We try to identify the reasons for the superior performance of ANN-based techniques over other techniques. We also classify the extant literature according to applications in different phases and types of disasters. The phases are ‘Mitigation and Preparedness', and ‘Response and Recovery’. The type of disasters includes flood, earthquake, storm, fire hazard/wildfire, and others. We identify some important patterns from this review. The findings establish the following: (i) ANNs are popularly used to predict and manage floods, (ii) Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) are the commonly used architecture, and (iii) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are most promising for extracting social media information during emergencies. We identify the limitations of this study and offer several potential directions for future research.

AB  - Reliability of a water level ensemble prediction system (WL-EPS) is directly related to the quality of the available data and the processes integrated into each predictive layer. In this project, we evaluate a hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system (H-EPS) coupled to a hydraulic module (HM) developed on the Chaudière River watershed in Quebec, Canada. Ensemble streamflow forecasts account for the three main sources of uncertainty: meteorology (ensemble forecasts), initial conditions (through data assimilation), and model structure (multimodel). The HM consists of a 1D river model that is informed at the boundary conditions by the H-EPS outputs. In order to evaluate the forecasting system in an operational context, a sampling procedure is implemented on the hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts in order to limit the simulation time of the hydraulic component without altering the description of the uncertainty provided beforehand. Forecasts reliability and accuracy are evaluated, for events of various magnitude covering a wide range of flows, based on performance metrics such as the reliability diagram and the continuous rank probability score (CRPS). Overall, results show that the performances of the ensemble flow and water level forecasts provided by the proposed system are quite reliable over the range of forecast horizons evaluated. Water level forecasts are dependent on the quality of the streamflow forecast, which is coherent with the assumption that streamflow is the main source of uncertainty of the HM. However, at control point where flow and water level forecasts are available, a slight deterioration in the forecast reliability is noted from flow to water level; nonetheless, the reliability of the forecasts remains comparable, thus confirming the strong link between the H-EPS and HM uncertainties. Consideration of the uncertainty related to the roughness coefficient uncertainty turned out to have a negligible effect on the spread of the water level forecasts, confirming once more the domination of the hydrologic uncertainty.

AB  - Global warming is exacerbating weather, and climate extremes events and is projected to aggravate multi-sectorial risks. A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000–2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.

AB  - Water levels are essential components for the observation and management of water resources. However, the existing water level monitoring methods either require manpower, which is inefficient, or are restricted to a certain environment. This paper proposes a novel approach that can automatically monitor, recognize and calculate the water level based on deep learning. First, a series of experiments were performed in a physical pool to obtain images from real scenes. Then, the original Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) preprocessing model was trained and optimized. Subsequently, a trained and verified staff gauge detection model was obtained, which was applied to extract the staff gauge information from images. Finally, a 24-hour time series of water level changes was simulated and analyzed using photographic images principle, and the NSE and R2 were 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in practice and can provide a relatively accurate and reliable measurement technique.

AB  - Strong convective systems and the associated heavy rainfall events can trig-ger floods and landslides with severe detrimental consequences. These events have a high spatio-temporal variability, being difficult to predict by standard meteorological numerical models. This work proposes the M5Images method for performing the very short-term prediction (nowcasting) of heavy convective rainfall using weather radar data by means of a convolutional recurrent neural network. The recurrent part of it is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Prediction tests were performed for the city and surroundings of Campinas, located in the Southeastern Brazil. The convolutional recurrent neural network was trained using time series of rainfall rate images derived from weather radar data for a selected set of heavy rainfall events. The attained pre-diction performance was better than that given by the persistence forecasting method for different prediction times.

AB  - Accurate prediction of soil moisture (SM) and soil temperature (ST) plays an important role in Earth system science, helping to forecast and understand ecosystem changes. They present great challenges because land-atmospheric interactions are complex and diverse in space and time. Although deep learning methods have excellent performance for land surface variables’ prediction such as SM and ST, they are often questioned due to their over-parameterized black-box nature and neglect of physical knowledge and interpretability. From this, we propose an attention-aware LSTM Model (ILSTM_Soil) by taking multi-feature attention, predictor attention and temporal attention into account. We first used LSTM to generate multi-feature vectors of all predictors, and then the three attention mechanisms were designed to summarize these feature vectors for SM and ST prediction. Experiment results for SM and ST prediction at the lead time of 1 and 7 days on ten FLUXNET sites suggest that the proposed ILSTM_Soil model outperforms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Elastic-Net (ENET), original Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and attention LSTM (A-LSTM) models in most cases. The interpretation of attention weights verifies that the proposed model can capture physical knowledge over SM and ST. The code of ILSTM_Soil is made publicly available and we hope it can encourage researchers to develop effective DL models in land surface variables’ prediction conveniently.

AB  - Stochastic simulation has been employed for producing long-term records and assessing the impact of climate change on hydrological and climatological variables in the future. However, traditional stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables often underestimates the variability and correlation structure of larger timescale due to the preservation of long-term memory. However, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, one type of recurrent neural network (RNN), employed in different fields, exhibits a remarkable long-term memory characteristic owing to the recursive hidden and cell states. The current study, therefore, applied the LSTM model to the stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables to examine how good the LSTM model can preserve the long-term memory and overcome the drawbacks of conventional time series models. The simulation involved a trigonometric function and the Rössler system as well as real case studies for hydrological and climatological variables. Results showed that the LSTM model reproduced the variability and correlation structure of the larger timescale as well as the key statistics of the original time domain better than the traditional models. The hidden and cell states of the LSTM containing the long-memory and oscillation structure following the observations allows better performance compared to the other tested conventional models. This better representation of the long-term variability can be critical in water manager since future water resources planning and management is highly related with this long-term variability. Thus, it is concluded that the LSTM model can be a potential alternative for the stochastic simulation of hydroclimatological variables. Also, note that another long-term memory model such as Gated Recurrent Unit can be also applicable.

AB  - It is essential to have accurate and reliable daily-inflow forecasting to improve short-term hydropower scheduling. This paper proposes a Causal multivariate Empirical mode Decomposition (CED) framework as a complementary pre-processing step for a day-ahead inflow forecasting problem. The idea behind CED is combining physics-based causal inference with signal processing-based decomposition to get the most relevant features among multiple time-series to the inflow values. The CED framework is validated for two areas in Norway with different meteorological and hydrological conditions. The validation results show that using CED as a pre-processing step significantly enhances (up to 70%) the forecasting accuracy for various state-of-the-art forecasting methods.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in geohazard modelling has been rapidly growing in recent years, a trend that is observed in several research and application areas thanks to recent advances in AI. As a result, the increasing dependence on data driven studies has made its practical applications towards geohazards (landslides, debris flows, earthquakes, droughts, floods, glacier studies) an interesting prospect. These aforementioned geohazards were responsible for roughly 80% of the economic loss in the past two decades caused by all natural hazards. The present study analyses the various domains of geohazards which have benefited from classical machine learning approaches and highlights the future course of direction in this field. The emergence of deep learning has fulfilled several gaps in: i) classification; ii) seasonal forecasting as well as forecasting at longer lead times; iii) temporal based change detection. Apart from the usual challenges of dataset availability, climate change and anthropogenic activities, this review paper emphasizes that the future studies should focus on consecutive events along with integration of physical models. The recent catastrophe in Japan and Australia makes a compelling argument to focus towards consecutive events. The availability of higher temporal resolution and multi-hazard dataset will prove to be essential, but the key would be to integrate it with physical models which would improve our understanding of the mechanism involved both in single and consecutive hazard scenario. Geohazards would eventually be a data problem, like geosciences, and therefore it is essential to develop models that would be capable of handling large voluminous data. The future works should also revolve towards interpretable models with the hope of providing a reasonable explanation of the results, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of Explainable AI.

AB  - In response to the increasing threats of flash flooding, how to generate flood maps in real time has drawn great attention. In this study, a hybrid ML model was developed for flood map generation with multiple lead times based on the combination of the support vector regression (SVR) method and Heun’s scheme for numerical correction, in which the hydraulic simulation results are used for model training while rainfall and flood sensor data are used as input variables (namely, the SVR-RFN model). To evaluate the performance of the hybrid model, two additional SVR models were developed and used as references for comparison—the first one used rainfall as input variables without sensor data (namely, the SVR-R model), and the second one added flood sensor data as input variables without numerical correction (namely, the SVR-RF model). The three models are tested and compared with a hydraulic model for a historical event in Sanyei River Basin, Taiwan. Using the hydraulic model as the benchmark, the hybrid model performed the best by reducing 63% of flood depth error and had the least deterioration of accuracy as lead time increased. The SVR-RF model performed the second by reducing the flood depth errors by 46% whereas the hydraulic model was more accurate than the SVR-R model. In a comparison of flood extents, the hydraulic model showed overestimation, the SVR-R model showed significant underestimation, whereas the two models with sensor data had balanced predictions. The flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied for dike safety evaluation and showed a good capability in forecasting the risk of dike breach.

AB  - Compound flooding (CF), as a result of oceanic, hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic drivers, is often studied with hydrodynamic models that combine either successive or concurrent processes to simulate inundation dynamics. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data fusion (DF) techniques have emerged as effective alternatives for post-flood mapping and supported current efforts of complex physical and dynamical modeling. Yet, those techniques have not been explored for large-scale (regional) compound flood mapping. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN & DF framework for generating CF maps along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). The framework fuses multispectral imagery from Landsat analysis ready data (ARD), dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data (SAR), and coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) to produce flood maps at moderate (30 m) spatial resolution. The highest overall accuracy (97%) and f1-scores of permanent water/floodwater (99/100%) are achieved when ARD, SAR and DEM datasets are readily available and fused. Moreover, the resulting CF maps agree well (80%) with hindcast flood guidance maps of the Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment and can effectively match post-flood high water marks of the U.S. Geological Survey distributed in coastal counties. We ultimately evaluate the framework with different DF alternatives and highlight their usefulness for large-scale compound flood mapping as well as calibration of hydrodynamic models. The cost-effective approach proposed here enables efficient estimation of exposure to compound coastal flooding and is particularly useful in data scarce regions.

AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural hazards, causing several deaths and conspicuous damages all over the world. In this work, we explore the applicability of the Transformer neural network to the task of flood forecasting. Our goal consists in predicting the water level of a river one day ahead, by using the past water levels of its upstream branches as predictors. The methodology was validated on the severe flood that affected Southeast Europe in May 2014. The results show that the Transformer outperforms recurrent neural networks by more than 4% in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and 7% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, the Transformer requires lower computational costs with respect to recurrent networks. The forecasting errors obtained are considered acceptable according to the domain standards, demonstrating the applicability of the Transformer to the task of flood forecasting.

AB  - With a rapidly growing wind power capacity, wind speed forecasting is of great importance for secure and economical operation of power systems. Nonetheless, due to the volatility of wind speed, its prediction has always been a challenging task. Although utilization of promising noise reduction techniques can mitigate this problem to some extent, wavelet threshold denoising methods (WTDs) suffer from their boundary effects in practice. To address this issue, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is adopted as an alternative of WTDs to reduce the information redundancy of wind speed time series. Furthermore, multi-layer extreme learning machine (MLELM) is combined with WMF to form an ensemble model for one-step and multi-step wind speed forecasting. Besides, as a novel swarm algorithm, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), is utilized to improve the performance of MLELM. Finally, a data-driven ensemble model WMF-SSA-MLELM is proposed herein, which can be divided into three blocks, data preprocessing, optimization, and prediction. In the first block, WMF suppresses redundant noise in wind speed time series and makes it easier to extract essential features of wind speed. In the second block, SSA optimizes input weights and biases of hidden layers in the optimization stage. In the prediction block, MLELM with two hidden layers optimized by SSA provides the prediction of future wind speed by using denoised wind speed series obtained in the first two steps. The test results on four datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model WMF-SSA-MLELM, via comparison with all candidate models in both one-step and multi-step wind speed forecasting.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of renewable energy in power generation, the increasing uncertainty of renewable energy has significant influence on the stability of energy system. In order to handle the system uncertainty as well as satisfying the energy demand and supply, a short-term wind power probabilistic forecasting under uncertainty using the Gaussian mixed clustering-Deep neural network probabilistic forecasting (GMC-DeepNN-PF) is proposed. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study of a wind power data set from Kaggle is presented and comparisons among four different data situations and four different forecasting models are shown in this paper. The raw wind power data is firstly pre-processed based on Gaussian Mixture Model reducing data defects. After that, the cleaned data is extended for more information which can improve the output accuracy and time as a property is added to forecasting model. According to DeepNN-PF, deep conventional neural network concatenated with T distribution is then utilized for forecasting using extended data. The simulations and comparisons demonstrate the advancement of the proposed method.

AB  - Short-term water demand forecasting (StWDF) is the foundation stone in the derivation of an optimal plan for controlling water supply systems. Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, k-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that extending the data set significantly reduces the error by about 30%. However, it increases the training time.

KW  - Recurrent neural network
AB  - Rainfall-runoff modeling, a nonlinear time series process, is challenging and important in hydrological sciences. Among the data-driven approaches, those ones based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network show their promising performance. In this paper, for rainfall-runoff modeling, we propose a novel data-driven framework named long short-term memory based step-sequence (LSTM-SS) framework, which contains m specific models for m-step-ahead runoff predictions. This model uses the sequential information of runoff series and follows the causality in practice: the current runoff is not affected by the later meteorological data. To show its performance and advantages, we test it on 241 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS) data set and predict the 7-day-ahead runoff. The results show that our rainfall-runoff models outperform the benchmark (physically-based or data-driven) models significantly employing for the CAMELS data set, including the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine, a two-layer LSTM network, and a LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence network. For 1-day-ahead runoff predictions, the median of Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency for the 241 basins provided by our model is 0.85, while that provided by the two-layer LSTM network is 0.65. Furthermore, the results also show that our proposed LSTM-SS framework not only can significantly improve the performance of a single daily runoff prediction, but also has good performance for multiple-step-ahead runoff predictions.

AB  - Flood forecasting can provide accurate inferences and early warnings for flood control work during the flood season. Due to the variability of local rainfall and the complexity of geographic conditions, existing prediction methods were unable to accurately predict the flooding process in a particular basin. Additionally, the water level sensor generates a significant amount of noise in the inbound flow data during period measurement. To address these issues, this article proposes a real-time flood forecasting model, which is used to accurately predict flood trends and peak times in the flood period. The model uses a convolution kernel function to smooth out local noise and neighborhood values, minimizing the impact of non-stationary series on the training process while retaining the true evolution of the flood in the original data. In our model, we develop a time series attention mechanism that is used to apply various weights to time series input vectors, such as outflow flow and rainfall from upstream reservoirs, this mechanism also improves the accuracy of short-term series prediction. To obtain additional information about the output of the recurrent neural network layer, we also include a multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average module. This method can add a linear component to the output, allowing the prediction result to adapt to the input period's scale shift. This article develops matching models for interval and full basin floods based on the geographical characteristics of China's urban Reservoir and the river basin, thresholds are established based on the outflow from upstream reservoirs, which enables the flood forecasting system to dynamically adjust model parameters in response to the threshold, it also circumvents the scaling problem inherent in flood time series at various scales. We trained and predicted using 25 different types of floods in Ankang Reservoir from 2010 to 2020. Three on-site real-time forecasts of catastrophic flooding at the Ankang Reservoir were conducted in September 2021 to validate the model's accuracy. The algorithm's efficiency in forecasting flood inflows is demonstrated through comparisons to traditional hydrological models and other machine learning networks, and our model consistently forecasts the peak time and total flood volume with the least amount of error in the comparison algorithm.

AB  - Accurate and reliable multi-step-ahead flood forecasting is beneficial for reservoir operation and water resources management. The Encoder-Decoder (ED) that can tackle sequence-to-sequence problems is suitable for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. This study proposes a novel ED with an exogenous input (EDE) structure for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. The exogenous input can be the outputs of process-based hydrological models. This study constructs four multi-step-ahead flood forecasting approaches, including the Xinanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model, the single-output long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network with recursive strategies, the recursive ED combined with the LSTM neural network (LSTM-RED), and the LSTM-EDE models. The performance of these four models is evaluated and compared by the long-term 3 h hydrologic data series of the Lushui and Jianxi basins in China. The results show that the LSTM-RED model that integrates recursive strategies into the training process of neural networks is more advantageous than the LSTM model. The proposed LSTM-EDE model can overcome the exposure bias problem, simplify its model structure, increase the computational efficiency in the validation process, and improve the multi-step-ahead flood forecasting accuracy, as compared to the LSTM-RED model.

AB  - Climate change is expected to worsen streamflow conditions, in terms of their frequency and magnitude, in urbanized watersheds, which can directly result in flood scenarios of greater water surface displacements. To contribute to the scientific community's present flood mitigation and assessment activities, this study develops a generic engineering approach to construct multiscale homogenized deep neural networks (MHDNN), implemented with unified parallel C (MHDNN-UPC), by fusing mass and momentum conservation laws, as part of hydrodynamic modelling, with deep learning (DL) computations for the predictive modelling of water surface displacements due to peak streamflow conditions, as representative of flood scenarios. The approach is comprised of a series of systematic analyses, namely: (Phase A) derive homogenized effective solutions, via homogenization theory coupled with multiscale perturbation analysis for hydrodynamic modelling, to perform features extractions and constructing useful activation functions for training MHDNN predictive model(s); (Phase B) UPC implementation of MHDNN model(s) to improve their computational performance; and (Phase C) using available field datasets, pertaining to surface displacements in watersheds, to train, validate and test MHDNN-UPC model(s). The proposed predictive approach is then verified across 48 selected states in the United States for modelling their recorded displacements over the past 100 years, by achieving an average 10% improvement in its predictive accuracy, as compared to other traditional models, while also improving the model's computational performance with the implemented UPC component.

AB  - Due to climate change, it is important to study the relationship between floods and sea-level rise in coastal city resilience. In this research sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS, wind speed, precipitation, and sea-level rise from satellite altimetry are investigated for dynamic sea-level variability. An annual SST increase of 0.1C° is observed around the Gothenburg coast. Also in the middle of the North Sea, an annual increase of about 0.2C° is evident. The annual sea surface height (SSH) trend is 3 mm on the Gothenburg coast. We have a strong positive spatial correlation between SST and SSH near the Gothenburg coast. In the next step, dynamic sea-level variability is predicted with a convolution neural network and long short term memory. Root mean square error of wind speed, precipitation, SST, and mean sea-level forecasts are ±0.84 m/s, ±48.75 mm, ±3.48C° and ±24 mm, respectively. The 5-year trends of mean seal level show a significant increase from 28 mm/year to 46 mm/year in the last 5 year periods and the rate of increase has doubled. In the final step, the water rise of 5–10 m in Gothenburg city was simulated, and in the worst scenario, more than 50 % of the city will be damaged.

AB  - Prediction using neural networks is applied in various fields, including hydrology and water resource management. In the learning process, an optimizer is used to determine the relationship (weights and biases) between the input and output data to lower the value of the loss function. Existing optimizers rely absolutely on the relationship that are initially generated and have the probability to converge to a local optimum. Additionally, since there is no structure for storing information about the previously generated correlation, there is a probability that the optimal weights and biases could not be found even when learning proceeds. It is necessary to apply a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that can consider both global/local search and has a structure that can store the previously generated solution. In this study, a new optimizer was combined with a harmony search (HS), to improve existing optimizers. To test the performance of the improved multi-layer perceptron using the new optimizer (IMLP), the runoff of the Dorim stream in Seoul was predicted. The rainfall and the discharge of pump stations were constructed as input data, and data preprocessing was performed by normalization and correlation coefficients. The IMLP showed improved accuracy and could be used to manage urban streams.

KW  - Neuro-Fuzzy model
KW  - SINFIM framework
AB  - Modeling the relationship between rainfall and runoff is an important issue in hydrology, but it is a complicated task because both the high levels of complexity in which both processes are embedded and the associated uncertainty, affect the forecasting. Neuro-fuzzy models have emerged as a useful approach, given the ability of neural networks to optimize parameters in a fuzzy system. In this work a Self-Identification Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Model (SINFIM) for modeling the relationship between rainfall and runoff on a Chilean watershed is proposed to reduce the uncertainty of selecting both the rainfall and runoff lags and the number of membership functions required in a fuzzy system. The data comes from the Diguillín river located in Ñuble region and average daily runoff and average daily rainfall recorded from years 2000 to 2018, according to the Chilean directorate of water resources (DGA). In addition, we worked with the Colorado River basin, located in the Maule region, to validate the method developed. The experimental results showed a good adjustment using the last 3 years as validation set, further improvement was achieved using only the last year was used as validation test, obtaining 84% of R2 and 0,91 Kling Gupta Efficiency, higher than other forecasting models such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial neural networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach. In addition, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent BIAS indicate the method is a promising model. On the other hand, even better results were obtained in the validation basin, whose adjustment was 94% and an efficiency of 97%. Therefore, the proposed model is a solid alternative to forecast the runoff in a given watershed, obtaining good performance measurements, managing to predict both the low and peak runoff values from rainfall events, avoiding the requirement to determine a priori the lags of time series and the number of fuzzy rules.

AB  - This study addresses Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model simulation issues in web environments and identifies key model parameters to facilitate practical flood forecasting. Jython scripts serving as an intermedium layer between the web-based forecast system and HEC-HMS model were created to enable HEC-DSS database writing and reading and HEC-HMS model execution as a background process. Empirical relationships between model parameters and time series characteristics were established to mitigate the difficulty in determining event-dependent model parameters. An open-source web-based prototype system for flood simulation and forecasting (WSFF) based on the HEC-HMS was built by incorporating these methods and parameter knowledge into the model and knowledge subsystem. The WSFF performance was evaluated via a case study involving 12 historical flood events in the Chuanchang watershed, southeastern China. Among these 12 events, nine events served as calibration events to establish WSFF parameter knowledge, and three events were used to verify the WSFF performance. A consistent and satisfactory performance in terms of peak flow, total flood volume, peak flow timing and overall hydrograph fitting effect was found. The average Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the validation events reached 0.81 versus 0.82 for the calibration events. The relative error in peak flow (REP) and relative error in flood volume (REV) indicated a reasonable flood forecasting accuracy, with an REP within 15% and RET within 1 h. Developed as open-source software, the WSFF could serve as a useful basis for the hydrological community regarding HEC-HMS adoption in flood forecasting.

AB  - Benchmarking computational intelligence algorithms provides valuable knowledge for selecting the best or, at least, the proper algorithm for a certain problem. The experimental results of the computational intelligence techniques applications in various domains, as well as the comparative studies that were reported in the literature can be analyzed and synthesized as development strategies for new successful applications of CI algorithms. Starting from an application domain-oriented survey of selected recently reported research work, the paper presents a general benchmarking framework applicable to computational intelligence algorithms and a set of guidelines for the selection of the best or more suitable CI algorithm for solving forecasting problems. Our approach proposes the integration of software and knowledge engineering best practice towards CI benchmarking, being a computational intelligence engineering methodology. The framework uses two knowledge bases, one for the application domain and one for the CI algorithms, providing heuristic knowledge for a more informed and efficient benchmarking, a case base in which solved problems are recorded with their solution and lessons that were learned, and a knowledge-based problem instance features selection. Some examples of how to apply the framework for problems of forecasting in seismology, environmental protection, hydrology and energy are also discussed. We point out that the framework might be implemented as a software tool (e.g. a decision support system) or as a tool suite. The main conclusion of our research work is that the integration of the derived knowledge from an application domain-oriented survey into the general benchmarking framework along with the set of guidelines for best or proper CI algorithms selection can improve significantly the forecasting accuracy and the response time, in case of real time forecasters.

Through experiments, various future predictions are tested, including a few hours or a day. As expected, RNN achieved the lowest error, but it could not capture rapid changes in river height levels. In comparison, the LSTM-SVR can better represent rapid transient changes in the data by using nonlinear kernels.

The field of porous media, and more generally geoscience, have also witnessed much progress, and recent progress in developing various ML techniques have benefitted various problems in porous media and geoscience across disparate scales. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is imperative to adopt advanced ML methods for the problems in porous media and geoscience because they enable researchers to solve many difficult problems. At the same time, one can use the already existing extensive knowledge of porous media to endow ML algorithms and develop novel physics-guided methods. The goal of this review paper is to provide the first comprehensive review of the recently developed methods in the ML algorithms and describe their application to porous media and geoscience. Thus, we review the basic concept of the ML and describe more advanced methods, known as deep-learning algorithms. Then, the application of such methods to various problems in porous media and geoscience, such as hydrological modeling, fluid flow in porous media, and (sub)surface characterization, are reviewed. We also provide a discussion of future directions in this rapidly developing field.

AB  - Reliable and accurate flood forecasting is a complex and challenging problem that is essential for the creation of disaster preparedness plans to protect life and reduce economic losses. This study suggests a novel hybrid model for real-time multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting within the Saint-Lawrence River in Quebec by integrating the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and improved outlier-robust extreme learning machine (IORELM) models. The DWTIORELM model was constructed with three main novelties: (i) Consider the sparsity characteristics of the outliers to enhance the performance of the ELM-based model in the presence of outliers, (ii) Introduce an iterative process to overcome the random definition of the two main matrices in the ELM-based approaches, (iii) Integrate IORELM with DWT as a preprocessing technique to decompose the main input signals to high-scale and low-frequency signals. The performance of the individual IORELM is compared with the original version of ELM, Regularized ELM (RELM), and Weighted RELM (WRELM) in terms of global accuracy and accuracy in peak flow forecasting. The results indicated that the IORELM outperformed other models. However, there was a need for a model that could perform better for peak flow detection. IORELM, as the best individual model, was integrated with DWT, and the DWTIORELM model was developed to overcome this limitation. In addition, the comparison results of the hybrid DWTIORELM and individual IORELM models in terms of accuracy and simplicity as well as peak flow forecasting indicate that the introduced hybrid model (R = 0.99, NSE = 0.99; RMSE = 0.234; NRMSE = 0.021; MARE = 0.02) in the current study not only overcomes all limitations of the existing ELM-based methods but also could be applied in multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting. The optimum values of the number of hidden neurons, decomposition level, and iteration number were found to be 200, 1, and 500, respectively. Furthermore, the Sigmoid function and Discrete Meyer (DM) were selected as the best activation function and mother wavelet, respectively. The developed hybrid model was applied to check its performance in multi-steps-ahead flood forecasting for one to nine hours ahead. The results showed that it could forecast peak flows with an average relative error of less than 5 %.

AB  - Floods are one of the most frequently occurring natural disasters. There are numerous studies devoted to comprehending and forecasting flooding in order to aid in preparedness and response. It is critical to share and communicate datasets generated by various systems and organizations for flood forecasting and modeling. The majority of organizations share limited metadata and details for flood risk data to support research and operational activities. However, there is no standardized way for various stakeholders and automated systems to exchange flood forecast and alert data. This article proposes the Flood Markup Language (FloodML) as a data communication specification for extensively describing and exchanging flood forecasts and alerts with corresponding stakeholders. FloodML is applicable to a broad range of data sharing use cases and requirements for emergency management, the research and modeling communities, and the general public.

AB  - Flash flood warning (FFW) systems play a fundamental role in flood hazard prevention and mitigation. In this study, we propose the first deep learning-based approach for large-scale FFW and demonstrate the application of this approach to mountainous and hilly areas of China. Specifically, the time series of precipitation before flash floods and three spatial features (maximum daily precipitation, curve number, and slope) are selected as predictors. A long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approach is adopted to predict the occurrence of flash floods, and we compare this approach with two widely used FFW methods, namely the rainfall triggering index (RTI) and flash flood guidance (FFG). The results demonstrate the following: (1) The LSTM-based approach provided a reliable FFW 1 day ahead with a hit rate (HR) of 0.84 and false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.09. It demonstrated moderate warning performance 2 days before flash floods, with an HR of 0.66 and FAR of 0.21. (2) The LSTM-based approach outperformed the benchmark RTI and FFG methods, achieving the highest critical success index (CSI) of 0.77. The FFG also provided satisfactory performance, with a CSI of 0.71, and the RTI demonstrated the lowest performance (CSI = 0.68). (3) The LSTM-based approach provides better results (CSI = 0.75) than RTI (CSI = 0.68) when only the time series of precipitation is used for prediction. The performance of the LSTM-based approach can be improved by considering the spatial features and a long time series of precipitation during model development. (4) The proposed approach did not exacerbate the effect of precipitation uncertainty on the flash flood warning; and we suggest using ensemble results for FFW to reduce the uncertainty caused by small or unbalanced learning samples. We conclude that the proposed approach is a valid method for large-scale FFW without using commercially sensitive observations, and can improve the capabilities of flood disaster mitigation, particularly in ungauged areas.

AB  - Recently accrued attention has been given to machine learning approaches for flooding prediction. However, most of these studies focused mainly on time-series flooding prediction at specified sensors, rarely on spatio-temporal prediction of inundations. In this work, an integrated long short-term memory (LSTM) and reduced order model (ROM) framework has been developed. This integrated LSTM-ROM has the capability of representing the spatio-temporal distribution of floods since it takes advantage of both ROM and LSTM. To reduce the dimensional size of large spatial datasets in LSTM, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches are introduced. The LSTM training and prediction processes are carried out over the reduced space. This leads to an improvement of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy. The performance of the LSTM-ROM developed here has been evaluated using Okushiri tsunami as test cases. The results obtained from the LSTM-ROM have been compared with those from the full model (Fluidity). In predictive analytics, it is shown that the results from both the full model and LSTM-ROM are in a good agreement whilst the CPU cost using the LSTM-ROM is decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to full model simulations. Additionally, prescriptive analytics has been undertaken to estimate the uncertainty in flood induced conditions. Given the time series of the free surface height at a specified detector, the corresponding induced wave conditions along the coastline have then been provided using the LSTM network. Promising results indicate that the use of LSTM-ROM can provide the flood prediction in seconds, enabling us to provide real-time predictions and inform the public in a timely manner, reducing injuries and fatalities.

AB  - Prediction of river flow rates is an essential task for both flood protection and optimal water resource management. The high uncertainty associated with basin characteristics, hydrological processes, and climatic factors affecting river flows make streamflow prediction a very challenging problem. These reasons, together with the increasingly wide availability of data relating to flow rates and rainfall, frequently lead to a preference for data-driven models over physically based or conceptual forecasting models. This study shows the results of an in-depth comparison between two different daily streamflow prediction models: a novel simpler model based on the stacking of the Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms, using the Elastic Net algorithm as meta-learner, and a more complex model based on bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Bayesian optimization was employed in selecting hyperparameters. The two prediction models were compared through the analysis of four different case studies: the Bacchiglione River, the Raccoon River, the Wilson River, and the Trent River. The two models showed comparable forecasting capabilities. In the most favourable cases, both models demonstrated very high accuracy (R2 greater than 0.93, Mean absolute percentage error approximately equal to 10%). The stacked model outperformed the bi-directional LSTM network model in several cases in predicting peak flow rates but was less accurate in forecasting low flow rates. In addition, its computation times are significantly shorter. The prediction accuracy of both models decreased as the forecast horizon increased. The length of the time series plays an essential role in developing models with satisfactory forecasting capabilities. In this study, the effectiveness of forecasting models was not influenced by the river regime. However, a high variance of the input dataset and a large number of outliers in the time series can reduce the accuracy of prediction models.

AB  - Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gaugingstations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE ≈1.30% and RMAE ≈ 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.

AB  - With recent developments in computational techniques, Data-driven Machine Learning Models (DMLs) have shown great potential in simulating streamflow and capturing the rainfall-runoff relationship in given watersheds, which are traditionally fulfilled by Process-based Hydrologic Models (PHMs). There are debates on whether the DMLs can outperform and possibly replace the classical PHMs for streamflow simulation and river forecasting, but no clear conclusions have been made. This study aims to investigate whether the newer DMLs have any potential in further improving the simulation accuracy of classical PHMs, and vice versa. To do this, we compared a few popular PHMs and DMLs over four watersheds across the Continental US (CONUS) that are associated with different input, climate, and regional conditions. A total of five hydrologic models were chosen, including (1) two classical lumped models, i.e., the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and Xinanjiang (XAJ); (2) one modern distributed model, termed Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST); (3) and two DMLs including an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a deep learning model, termed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Our results demonstrated that the DMLs still significantly biased when using the baseline input scenario with the PHMs. However, the DMLs fed with delayed input scenarios had great potential and can reach high simulation accuracy. The DMLs, especially the ANN, outperformed other employed models under the rainfall-runoff relationship in which rainfall dominantly drives. The DMLs also showed better performance in the high-flow regime, while the PHMs had a better performance for the low-flow regime, implying both PHMs and DMLs have their own merits and are worthy of joint development. In general, our study indicated a great potential of using DMLs to simulate streamflow, but further studies are still needed to verify the transferability and scalability of DMLs in large-scale experiments, such as the Distributed Model Intercomparison Projects 1&2 conducted by National Weather Services but to compare modern DMLs and PHMs.

AB  - Global climate change has led to an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme events around the world, the risk of which is especially imminent in tropical regions. Developing hydrological models with better capabilities to simulate streamflow, especially peak flow, is urgently needed to facilitate water resource planning and management as well as climate change mitigation efforts in the tropics. In view of the need, this paper explores the feasibility of improving streamflow simulation performance in the tropical Kelantan River Basin (KRB) of Peninsular Malaysia through coupling a conceptual process-based hydrological model − Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a deep learning model − Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) in two ways. All SWAT parameters were set as their default values in one hybrid model (SWAT-D-LSTM), whereas three most sensitive SWAT parameters were calibrated in the other hybrid model (SWAT-T-LSTM). Comparison of daily streamflow simulation results have shown that SWAT-T-LSTM consistently performs better than SWAT-D-LSTM as well as the stand-alone SWAT and Bi-LSTM model throughout the simulation period. Particularly, SWAT-T-LSTM performs considerably better than the other three models in simulating daily peak flow. Based on the latest projection results of five GCMs from the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) under three emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5), the best-performed SWAT-T-LSTM was run to assess the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow in the KRB. Ensemble assessment results have concluded that both average and extreme streamflow is much likely to increase considerably in the already wet northeast monsoon season from November to January, which has surely raised the alarm for more frequent flood occurrence in the KRB.

AB  - Due to the non-cognition of real-time data, rare loss-based risk warning methods can effectively respond to unexpected emergencies. Machine learning has powerful data processing capabilities and real-time computing functions and thus is suitable for offsetting the shortcomings of traditional risk methods. Risk analysis can be easily employed to perform risk-based data classification for a set of process data. However, the risk analysis process is too complicated to label risk levels for all processes, which is hard to satisfy the requirements of the amount of data for supervised learning. Therefore, the present paper focuses on developing semi-supervised learning methods for the construction of real-time risk-based early warning systems. By using fuzzy HAZOP, we estimate the risk of systems quantitatively based on the process data. With the consideration of scarce labeled data and numerous unlabeled information, we develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based semi-supervised learning method to identify the process risk timely. Besides, deep network architecture integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the codification of multi-dimensional process data to enhance the generalization of warning models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through a comparative study with different algorithms on a case of multizone circulating reactor (MZCR).

AB  - This study aims to explore the reliability of flood warning forecasts based on deep learning models, in particular Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. We also wish to verify the applicability of flood event predictions for a river with flood events lasting only a few hours, with the aid of hydrometric control stations. This methodology allows for the creation of a system able to identify flood events with acceptable errors within several hours' notice. In terms of errors, the results obtained in this study can be compared to those obtained by using physics-based models for the same study area. These kinds of models use few types of data, unlike physical models that require the estimation of several parameters. However, the deep learning models are data-driven and for this reason they can influence the results obtained. Therefore, we tested the stability of the models by simulating the missing or wrong input data of the model, and this allowed us to achieve excellent results. Indeed, the models were stable even if several data were missing. This method makes it possible to lay the foundations for the future application of these techniques when there is an absence of geological-hydrogeological information preventing physical modeling of the run-off process or in cases of relatively small basins, where the complex system and the unsatisfactory modeling of the phenomenon do not allow a correct application of physical-based models. The forecast of flood events is fundamental for correct and adequate territory management, in particular when significant climatic changes occur. The study area is that of the Arno River (in Tuscany, Italy), which crosses some of the most important cities of central Italy, in terms of population, cultural heritage, and socio-economic activities.

AB  - Various forms of machine learning (ML) methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental remote sensing research. With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.

Still, its high sampling frequency leads to a large amount of real-time calculation, posing a great challenge to the industrial application of monitoring technology. Attention weight statistics (AWS) is proposed to obtain the key frames of AE signals in LSP processing to solve this problem. Compared with the original AE signal, key frames set of the signal provide greater test accuracy while effectively reducing the amount of data. Based on the highest accuracy and the shortest test time of key frames set, the best sensors of signal acquisition in four different sensors are evaluated, and the results can be used as a reference for future experiments. Finally, the physical significance of AE signal key frames is explained with time–frequency domain analysis.

This study proposed a Long Short-Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) model for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting for the first time. The Shihmen Reservoir catchment in Taiwan constituted the case study. A total of 12,216 hourly hydrological data collected from 23 typhoon events were allocated into three datasets for model training, validation, and testing. The input sequence of the model contained hourly reservoir inflows and rainfall data (traced back to the previous 8 h) of ten gauge stations, and the output sequence stepped into 1- up to 6-hour-ahead reservoir inflow forecasts. A feed forward neural network-based Encoder-Decoder (FFNN-ED) model was established for comparison purposes. This study conducted model training a number of times with various initial weights to evaluate the accuracy, stability, and reliability of the constructed FFNN-ED and LSTM-ED models. The results demonstrated that both models, in general, could provide suitable multi-step ahead forecasts, and the proposed LSTM-ED model not only could effectively mimic the long-term dependence between rainfall and runoff sequences but also could make more reliable and accurate flood forecasts than the FFNN-ED model. Concerning the time delay between the time horizons of model inputs (rainfall) and model outputs (runoff), the impact assessment of this time-delay on model performance indicated that the LSTM-ED model achieved similar forecast performance when fed with antecedent rainfall either at a shorter horizon of 4 h in the past (T − 4) or at horizons longer than 7 h in the past (>T − 7). We conclude that the proposed LSTM-ED that translates and links the rainfall sequence with the runoff sequence can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the interpretability of model internals.

AB  - Multi-task learning employs a shared representation of knowledge for learning several instances of the same problem. Multi-step time series problem is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning methods. The performance of a prediction model face challenges for higher prediction horizons due to the accumulation of errors. Cooperative coevolution employs in a divide and conquer approach for training neural networks and has been very promising for single step ahead time series prediction. Recently, co-evolutionary multi-task learning has been proposed for dynamic time series prediction. In this paper, we adapt co-evolutionary multi-task learning for multi-step prediction where predictive recurrence is developed to feature knowledge from previous states for future prediction horizon. The goal of the paper is to present a network architecture with predictive recurrence which is capable of multi-step prediction through a form of multi-task learning. We employ cooperative neuro-evolution and an evolutionary algorithm as baselines for comparison. The results show that the proposed method provides the best generalization performance in most cases. Comparison of results with the literature has shown to be promising which motivates further application of the approach for related real-world problems.

AB  - Summary
This perspective discusses the importance of characterizing, quantifying, and accounting for various sources of uncertainties involved in different layers of hydrometeorological and hydrodynamic model simulations as well as their complex interactions and cascading effects (e.g., uncertainty propagation) in forecasting compound flooding (CF). Over the past few decades, CF has come to attention across the globe as this natural hazard results from a combination of either concurrent or successive flood drivers with larger economic, societal, and environmental impacts than those from isolated drivers. A warming climate and increased urbanization in flood-prone areas are expected to contribute to an escalation in the risk of CF in the near future. Recent advances in remote sensing and data science can provide a wide range of possibilities to account for and reduce the predictive uncertainties; hence improving the predictability of CF events, enabling risk-informed decision-making, and ensuring a sustainable CF risk governance.
