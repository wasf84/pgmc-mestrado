AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural hazards, causing several deaths and conspicuous damages all over the world. In this work, we explore the applicability of the Transformer neural network to the task of flood forecasting. Our goal consists in predicting the water level of a river one day ahead, by using the past water levels of its upstream branches as predictors. The methodology was validated on the severe flood that affected Southeast Europe in May 2014. The results show that the Transformer outperforms recurrent neural networks by more than 4% in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and 7% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, the Transformer requires lower computational costs with respect to recurrent networks. The forecasting errors obtained are considered acceptable according to the domain standards, demonstrating the applicability of the Transformer to the task of flood forecasting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A flood is a significant damaging natural calamity that causes loss of life and property. Earlier work on the construction of floodpredictionmodels intended to reduce risks, suggest policies, reduce mortality, and limit property damage caused by floods. The massive amount of data generated by social media platforms such as Twitter opens the door to flood analysis. Because of the real-time nature of Twitter data, some government agencies and authorities have used it to track natural catastrophe events in order to build a more rapid rescue strategy. However, due to the shorter duration of Tweets, it is difficult to construct a perfect prediction model for determining flood. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches can be used to statistically develop flood prediction models. At the same time, the vast amount of Tweets necessitates the use of a big data analytics (BDA) tool for flood prediction. In this regard, this work provides an optimal deep learning-based flood forecasting model with big data analytics (ODLFF-BDA) based on Twitter data. The suggested ODLFF-BDA technique intends to anticipate the existence of floods using tweets in a big data setting. The ODLFF-BDA technique comprises data pre-processing to convert the input tweets into a usable format. In addition, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is used to generate emotive contextual embedding from tweets. Furthermore, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a Multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (MLCNN) is used to extract local data and predict the flood. Finally, an Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) is used to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the GRU and MLCNN models in order to increase prediction performance. The memory usage is pull down lesser than 3.5 MB, if its compared with the other algorithm techniques. The ODLFF-BDA technique’s performance was validated using a benchmark Kaggle dataset, and the findings showed that it outperformed other recent approaches significantly. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

AB  - This study proposes a method for predicting the long-term temporal two-dimensional range and depth of flooding in all grid points by using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The deep learning model was trained using a large rainfall dataset obtained from actual flooding events, and the corresponding raster flood data computed using a physical model. Various rainfall distributions (at different times or over different accumulation periods), the mesh of the simulated area, and the topography of the simulated area were considered when evaluating the performance of two CNNs: a simple CNN and Inception CNN. Neither CNN architecture could converge when the coordinate information was not included in the input data. Adding terrain elevation information to the rainfall data already containing coordinates increased the accuracy of flood prediction. Our findings indicated that in the proposed method, real-time flooding observation data are not required for corrections, and we concluded that the method can be used for long-term flood forecasting. Our model can accurately pinpoint when the water level changes from rising to falling. Once meteorological forecasted rainfall data are obtained, a corresponding long-term forecast of the two-dimensional flooding range and depth can be obtained within seconds. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates the capability of sequence-to-sequence machine learning (ML) architectures in an effort to develop streamflow forecasting tools for Canadian watersheds. Such tools are useful to inform local and region-specific water management and flood forecasting related activities. Two powerful deep-learning variants of the Recurrent Neural Network were investigated, namely the standard and attention-based encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Both models were forced with past hydro-meteorological states and daily meteorological data with a look-back time window of several days. These models were tested for 10 different watersheds from the Ottawa River watershed, located within the Great Lakes Saint-Lawrence region of Canada, an economic powerhouse of the country. The results of training and testing phases suggest that both models are able to simulate overall hydrograph patterns well when compared to observational records. Between the two models, the attention model significantly outperforms the standard model in all watersheds, suggesting the importance and usefulness of the attention mechanism in ML architectures, not well explored for hydrological applications. The mean performance accuracy of the attention model on unseen data, when assessed in terms of mean Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency and Kling-Gupta Efficiency is, respectively, found to be 0.985 and 0.954 for these watersheds. Streamflow forecasts with lead times of up to 5 days with the attention model demonstrate overall skillful performance with well above the benchmark accuracy of 70%. The results of the study suggest that the encoder–decoder LSTM, with attention mechanism, is a powerful modelling choice for developing streamflow forecasting systems for Canadian watersheds. © 2022, Crown.

AB  - We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach for the prediction of maximum water depth hazard maps at high spatial resolutions, which assigns well-calibrated uncertainty estimates to every predicted water depth. Efficient, accurate, and trustworthy methods for urban flood management have become increasingly important due to higher rainfall intensity caused by climate change, the expansion of cities, and changes in land use. While physically based flood models can provide reliable forecasts for water depth at every location of a catchment, their high computational burden is hindering their application to large urban areas at high spatial resolution. While deep learning models have been used to address this issue, a disadvantage is that they are often perceived as “black-box” models and are overconfident about their predictions, therefore decreasing their reliability. Our deep learning model learns the underlying phenomena a priori from simulated hydrodynamic data, obviating the need for manual parameter setting for every new rainfall event at test time. The only inputs needed at the test time are a rainfall forecast and parameters of the terrain such as a digital elevation model to predict the maximum water depth with uncertainty estimates for complete rainfall events. We validate the accuracy and generalisation capabilities of our approach through experiments on a dataset consisting of catchments within Switzerland and Portugal and 18 rainfall patterns. Our method produces flood hazard maps at 1 m resolution and achieves mean absolute errors as low as 21 cm for extreme flood cases with water above 1 m. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our approach is able to provide an uncertainty estimate for every water depth within the predicted hazard map, thus increasing the model’s trustworthiness during flooding events. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Flood forecasting is among the most important precaution measures to prevent devastating disasters affecting human life, properties, and the overall environment. It is closely involved with precipitation and streamflow data forecasting tasks. In this work, we introduced a multi-step discharge prediction framework based on deep learning models. A simple feature representation technique using a correlation of backward lags was enhanced with a time of concentration (TC) concept. Recurrent neural networks and their variants, coupled with the TC-related features, provided superior performance with over 0.9 Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and substantially high correlation values for multiple forecasted points. These results were consistent among both the Upper Nan and the Loei river basins in Thailand, which were used as case studies in this work. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A flood is one of the most hazardous natural disasters, and it commonly causes fatalities and socioeconomic damages. The advances of modeling techniques and observation data in flood prediction have found success in field operations. This paper presents a comprehensive flood prediction of Hurricane Harvey in 1-hour lead-time that is not limited to 1D streamflow forecast but also 2D flood extent and 3D inundation depth. It uses high-resolution quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs, from operational Rapid Refresh-RAP, and High Resolution Rapid Refresh-HRRR models) and deep learning nowcasts (AI nowcasts). The results show that the QPFs have a well-known displacement issue and the AI nowcast cannot predict the precipitation intensity, and an attempt to combine the two methods (AI hybrid) failed to improve the overall accuracy. However, the 2D flood extent predictions with the HRRR and AI hybrid forcings can provide information indicating the future flooded area with about 50% accuracy (hit rate) and stream flow prediction showed that the HRRR QPF can provide relatively accurate flood peak prediction (-8%). In contrast, the AI nowcast reveals minimal displacement errors but underpredicts precipitation intensity. The deep learning method also indicates that the binary tests with low threshold, which are commonly employed in the deep learning field, neglect the importance of precipitation intensity errors for extreme event studies. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Machine learning especially deep learning methods have been widely used for runoff prediction in recent years. Models based on the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework were recently introduced into the field of rainfall-runoff modeling. In this paper, we demonstrate a new design of a seq2seq model which shows higher prediction accuracy than previous seq2seq models. Our new design takes advantage of the high linear correlation between historical runoff and future runoff, and processes the runoff input through a linear layer. Our new seq2seq model, named seq2seq-lrp (linear runoff processing), is combined with the attention mechanism (seq2seq-lrp-a), and compared with three seq2seq benchmark models (seq2seq-1, seq2seq-2, and seq2seq-3). The five models (seq2seq-lrp, seq2seq-lrp-a, seq2seq-1, seq2seq-2, seq2seq-3) were used to simulate runoff in the Yutan sub-catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly runoff and rainfall measurements from 2000 to 2014. The results show that the novel seq2seq-lrp and seq2seq-lrp-a models are better suited in hourly flood prediction than the seq2seq benchmark models and the seq2seq-lrp-a model performs best among the five models. © 2022

AB  - Flood is a natural calamity and is needed to be controlled in a specific manner. In this paper, flood forecasting is carried out using Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the banks of river Daya and Bhargavi that flows across Odisha, India. A comparative study is done using other machine learning techniques to elaborately show the impact of barrage construction. The performance of DBN is established by comparing it with Teaching Learning-Based Optimization method (TLBO) with the use of many parameters like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The flood forecasting is done for 1 day, 1 week and 2 weeks of time period using both the rivers, i.e. Daya and Bhargavi with the use of DBN and TLBO technique. © 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring, agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals (approximately 25–55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications. In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the Wide &amp; Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer SM product (L3_SM_P). In this method, horizontally and vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv, respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST), topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the SMAP SM (L3_SM_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km. Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715. The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to 0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate and reliable multi-step-ahead flood forecasting is beneficial for reservoir operation and water resources management. The Encoder-Decoder (ED) that can tackle sequence-to-sequence problems is suitable for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. This study proposes a novel ED with an exogenous input (EDE) structure for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. The exogenous input can be the outputs of process-based hydrological models. This study constructs four multi-step-ahead flood forecasting approaches, including the Xinanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model, the single-output long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network with recursive strategies, the recursive ED combined with the LSTM neural network (LSTM-RED), and the LSTM-EDE models. The performance of these four models is evaluated and compared by the long-term 3 h hydrologic data series of the Lushui and Jianxi basins in China. The results show that the LSTM-RED model that integrates recursive strategies into the training process of neural networks is more advantageous than the LSTM model. The proposed LSTM-EDE model can overcome the exposure bias problem, simplify its model structure, increase the computational efficiency in the validation process, and improve the multi-step-ahead flood forecasting accuracy, as compared to the LSTM-RED model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flood forecasting is an essential non-engineering measure for flood prevention and disaster reduction. Many models have been developed to study the complex and highly random rainfall-runoff process. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), have attempted to construct rainfall-runoff models. The more advanced deep learning methods of long short-term memory (LSTM) network have been proved to better predict hydrological time series. However, the selection of LSTM hyperparameters in the past mostly relied on the experience of the staff, which often led to failure to achieve the best performance. The aim of this study is to develop a method to improve flood forecast accuracy and lead time. A deep learning neural network model based on LSTM networks and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper. The PSO algorithm was used to optimize the LSTM hyperparameter to improve the ability to learn data sequence features. The model focuses on the Jingle Watershed in the Fenhe River and the Lushi Watershed in the Luohe River and was used to predict flood processes using rainfall and runoff observation data from stations in the watersheds. We evaluated the performance of the model with the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and bias. The results show that the PSO-LSTM model outperforms the M-EIES, ANN, PSO-ANN, and LSTM at all stations in the watersheds. The PSO-LSTM model improves the flood forecasting accuracy at different lead times, especially for those exceeding 6 h, and has higher prediction accuracy and stability. The PSO-LSTM model could be used to improve accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrological simulation plays a very important role in understanding the hydrological processes and is of great significance to flood forecasting and optimal allocation of water resources in the watershed. The development of deep learning techniques has brought new opportunities and methods for long-term hydrological simulation research at the watershed scale. Different from traditional hydrological models, the application of deep learning techniques in the hydrological field has greatly promoted the development trend of runoff prediction and provides a new paradigm for hydrological simulation. In this study, a CNN–LSTM model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a CNN–GRU model based on CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRN) are constructed to study the watershed hydrological processes. To compare the performance of deep learning techniques and the hydrological model, we also constructed the distributed hydrological model: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model based on remote sensing data. These models were applied to the Xixian Basin, and the promising results had been achieved, which verified the rationality of the method, with the majority of percent bias error (PBE) values ranging between 3.17 and 13.48, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.63 and 0.91, and Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.70 and 0.90 on a monthly scale. The results demonstrated their strong ability to learn complex hydrological processes. The results also indicated that the proposed deep learning models could provide the certain decision support for the water environment management at the watershed scale, which was of great significance to improve the hydrological disaster prediction ability and was conducive to the sustainable development of water resources.

AB  - With increasing urbanization, flooding is a major challenge for many cities today. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to explore the reliability of flood warning forecasts based on deep learning models, in particular Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. We also wish to verify the applicability of flood event predictions for a river with flood events lasting only a few hours, with the aid of hydrometric control stations. This methodology allows for the creation of a system able to identify flood events with acceptable errors within several hours' notice. In terms of errors, the results obtained in this study can be compared to those obtained by using physics-based models for the same study area. These kinds of models use few types of data, unlike physical models that require the estimation of several parameters. However, the deep learning models are data-driven and for this reason they can influence the results obtained. Therefore, we tested the stability of the models by simulating the missing or wrong input data of the model, and this allowed us to achieve excellent results. Indeed, the models were stable even if several data were missing. This method makes it possible to lay the foundations for the future application of these techniques when there is an absence of geological-hydrogeological information preventing physical modeling of the run-off process or in cases of relatively small basins, where the complex system and the unsatisfactory modeling of the phenomenon do not allow a correct application of physical-based models. The forecast of flood events is fundamental for correct and adequate territory management, in particular when significant climatic changes occur. The study area is that of the Arno River (in Tuscany, Italy), which crosses some of the most important cities of central Italy, in terms of population, cultural heritage, and socio-economic activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bangladesh is in the floodplains of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna River delta, crisscrossed by an intricate web of rivers. Although the country is highly prone to flooding, the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models in predicting river water levels to aid flood forecasting is underexplored. Deep learning and attention-based models have shown high potential for accurately forecasting floods over space and time. The present study aims to develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and its attention-based architectures to predict flood water levels in the rivers of Bangladesh. The models developed in this study incorporated gauge-based water level data over 7 days for flood prediction at Dhaka and Sylhet stations. This study developed five models: artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, spatial attention LSTM (SALSTM), temporal attention LSTM (TALSTM), and spatiotemporal attention LSTM (STALSTM). The multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method was applied to address missing data in the time series analysis. The results showed that the use of both spatial and temporal attention together increases the predictive performance of the LSTM model, which outperforms other attention-based LSTM models. The STALSTM-based flood forecasting system, developed in this study, could inform flood management plans to accurately predict floods in Bangladesh and elsewhere. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Since flooding in urban areas is rarely observed using sensors, most researchers use artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict flood hazards based on model simulation data. However, there is still a gap between simulation and real flooding phenomenon due to the limitation of the model. Few studies have reported on the AI model for flood inundation depth forecasting based on observed data. This study presents a novel method integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) with moving average (MA) for flood inundation depth forecasting based on observed data. A flood-prone intersection in Rende District, Tainan, Taiwan, was adopted as the study area. This investigation compared the forecasting performance of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and LSTM models. Accumulated rainfall (Ra) and the moving average (MA) method were applied to enhance the LSTM model performance. The model forecast accuracy was evaluated using root mean square error, coefficient of determination (R2) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Analytical results indicated that the LSTM had better forecasting ability than the RNN and BPNN, because LSTM had both long-term and short-term memory. Since Ra was an important factor in flooding, adding the Ra to the model input upgraded the LSTM forecasting accuracy for high inundation depths. Because MA reduced the noise of the data, processing the model output using the MA also elevated the forecasting accuracy for high inundation depths. For 3-step-ahead forecasting, the NSE of the model benchmark BPNN was 0.79. Using LSTM, Ra and MA, NSEs gradually increased to 0.83, 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - As a natural disaster, floods can cause enormous social and economic losses. However, both physical models and learning-based flood forecasting models require massive historical flood data to fit the model parameters. When come to new site that does not have sufficient historical data, the model performance will drop dramatically due to the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a Flood Domain Adaptation Network (FloodDAN) that is able to perform unsupervised flood forecasting. Specifically, we design a two-stage learning procedure to train our FloodDAN: in the first stage, we pretrain a rainfall encoder and a prediction head to learn general transferable hydrological knowledge on large-scale source domain data; in the second stage, we transfer the knowledge in the pretrained encoder into the rainfall encoder of target domain through adversarial domain alignment. During inference, we utilize the target domain rainfall encoder trained in the second stage and the prediction head trained in the first stage to get flood forecasting predictions. Experimental results on Tunxi and Changhua flood dataset show that our proposed FloodDAN can perform flood forecasting effectively with zero target domain supervision. The performance of the FloodDAN is on par with supervised models that uses 450-500 hours of supervision. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Rainfall-runoff models are valuable tools for flood forecasting, management of water resources, and drought warning. With the advancement in space technology, a plethora of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are available publicly. However, the application of the satellite data for the data-driven rainfall-runoff model is emerging and requires careful investigation. In this work, two satellite rainfall data sets, namely Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval Product V6 (GPM-IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), are evaluated for the development of rainfall-runoff models and the prediction of 1-day ahead streamflow. The accuracy of the data from the SPPs is compared to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)-gridded precipitation data set. Detection metrics showed that for light rainfall (1-10 mm), the probability of detection (POD) value ranges between 0.67 and 0.75 and with an increasing rainfall range, i.e., medium and heavy rainfall (10-50 mm and.50 mm), the POD values ranged from 0.24 to 0.45. These results indicate that the satellite precipitation performs satisfactorily with reference to the IMD-gridded data set. Using the daily precipitation data of nearly two decades (2000-2018) over two river basins in India's eastern part, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-time memory (LSTM) models are developed for rainfall-runoff modelling. One-day ahead runoff prediction using the developed rainfall-runoff modelling confirmed that both the SPPs are sufficient to drive the rainfall-runoff models with a reasonable accuracy estimated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, and the root-mean-squared error. In particular, the 1-day streamflow forecasts for the Vamsadhara river basin (VRB) using LSTM with GPM-IMERG inputs resulted in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSC) values of 0.68 and 0.67, while ELM models for Mahanadhi river basin (MRB) with the same input resulted in NSC values of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, during training and validation stages. At the same time, the LSTM model with CHIRPS inputs for the VRB resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.65, and the ELM model with CHIRPS inputs for the MRB resulted in NSC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively, in training and validation stages. These results indicated that both the SPPs could reliably be used with LSTM and ELM models for rainfall-runoff modelling and streamflow prediction. This paper highlights that deep learning models, such as ELM and LSTM, with the GPM-IMERG products can lead to a new horizon to provide flood forecasting in flood-prone catchments. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks represent one of the most prevalent deep learning (DL) architectures in current hydrological modeling, but they remain black boxes from which process understanding can hardly be obtained. This study aims to demonstrate the potential of interpretive DL in gaining scientific insights using flood prediction across the contiguous United States (CONUS) as a case study. Two interpretation methods were adopted to decipher the machine-captured patterns and inner workings of LSTM networks. The DL interpretation by the expected gradients method revealed three distinct input-output relationships learned by LSTM-based runoff models in 160 individual catchments. These relationships correspond to three flood-inducing mechanisms—snowmelt, recent rainfall, and historical rainfall—that account for 10.1%, 60.9%, and 29.0% of the 20,908 flow peaks identified from the data set, respectively. Single flooding mechanisms dominate 70.7% of the investigated catchments (11.9% snowmelt-dominated, 34.4% recent rainfall-dominated, and 24.4% historical rainfall-dominated mechanisms), and the remaining 29.3% have mixed mechanisms. The spatial variability in the dominant mechanisms reflects the catchments' geographic and climatic conditions. Moreover, the additive decomposition method unveils how the LSTM network behaves differently in retaining and discarding information when emulating different types of floods. Information from inputs within previous time steps can be partially stored in the memory of LSTM networks to predict snowmelt-induced and historical rainfall-induced floods, while for recent rainfall-induced floods, only recent information is retained. Overall, this study provides a new perspective for understanding hydrological processes and extremes and demonstrates the prospect of artificial intelligence-assisted scientific discovery in the future. © 2021.

AB  - Missing observational data pose an unavoidable problem in the hydrological field. Deep learning technology has recently been developing rapidly, and has started to be applied in the hydrological field. Being one of the network architectures used in deep learning, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been applied largely in related research, such as flood forecasting and discharge prediction, and the performance of an LSTM model has been compared with other deep learning models. Although the tuning of hyperparameters, which influences the performance of an LSTM model, is necessary, no sufficient knowledge has been obtained. In this study, we tuned the hyperparameters of an LSTM model to investigate the influence on the model performance, and tried to obtain a more suitable hyperparameter combination for the imputation of missing discharge data of the Daihachiga River. A traditional method, linear regression with an accuracy of 0.903 in Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), was chosen as the comparison target of the accuracy. The results of most of the trainings that used the discharge data of both neighboring and estimation points had better accuracy than the regression. Imputation of 7 days of the missing period had a minimum value of 0.904 in NSE, and 1 day of the missing period had a lower quartile of 0.922 in NSE. Dropout value indicated a negative correlation with the accuracy. Setting dropout as 0 had the best accuracy, 0.917 in the lower quartile of NSE. When the missing period was 1 day and the number of hidden layers were more than 100, all the compared results had an accuracy of 0.907–0.959 in NSE. Consequently, the case, which used discharge data with backtracked time considering the missing period of 1 day and 7 days and discharge data of adjacent points as input data, indicated better accuracy than other input data combinations. Moreover, the following information is obtained for this LSTM model: 100 hidden layers are better, and dropout and recurrent dropout levels equaling 0 are also better. The obtained optimal combination of hyperparameters exceeded the accuracy of the traditional method of regression analysis. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Early and accurate flood forecasting and warning for urban flood risk areas is an essential factor to reduce flood damage. This paper presents the urban flood forecasting and warning process to reduce damage in the main flood risk area of South Korea. This process is developed based on the rainfall-runoff model and deep learning model. A model-driven method was devised to construct the accurate physical model with combined inland-river and flood control facilities, such as pump stations and underground storages. To calibrate the rainfall-runoff model, data of gauging stations and pump stations of an urban stream in August 2020 were used, and the model result was presented as an R2 value of 0.63~0.79. Accurate flood warning criteria of the urban stream were analyzed according to the various rainfall scenarios from the model-driven method. As flood forecasting and warning in the urban stream, deep learning models, vanilla ANN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stack-LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM were constructed. Deep learning models using 10-min hydrological time-series data from gauging stations were trained to warn of expected flood risks based on the water level in the urban stream. A forecasting and warning method that applied the bidirectional LSTM showed an R2 value of 0.9 for the water level forecast with 30 min lead time, indicating the possibility of effective flood forecasting and warning. This case study aims to contribute to the reduction of casualties and flood damage in urban streams and accurate flood warnings in typical urban flood risk areas of South Korea. The developed urban flood forecasting and warning process can be applied effectively as a non-structural measure to mitigate urban flood damage and can be extended considering watershed characteristics. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time-series problem in the field of hydrology. Various methods, such as physical-driven and data-driven models, have been developed to study the highly random rainfall-runoff process. In the past 2 years, with the advancement of computing hardware resources and algorithms, deep-learning methods, such as temporal convolutional network (TCN), have been shown to be good prospects in time-series prediction tasks. The aim of this study is to develop a prediction model based on TCN structure to simulate the hourly rainfall-runoff relationship. We use two datasets in the Jingle and Kuye watersheds to test the model under different network structures and compare with the other four models. The results show that the TCN model outperforms the Excess Infiltration and Excess Storage Model (EIESM), artificial neural network, and long short-term memory and improves the flood forecasting accuracy at different foreseeable periods. It is shown that the TCN has a faster convergence rate and is an effective method for hydrological forecasting. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Satellite remote sensing precipitation is useful for many hydrological and meteorological applications such as rainfall-runoff forecasting. However, most studies have focused on the use of satellite precipitation on daily, monthly, or larger time scales. This study focused on flash flood simulation using satellite precipitation products (IMERG) on an hourly scale in a poorly gauged mountainous catchment in southwestern China. Deep learning (long short-term memory, LSTM) was used, merging satellite precipitation and gauge observations, and the merged precipitation data were used as inputs for flood simulation based on the HEC-HMS model, compared with the gauged precipitation data and original IMERG data. The results showed that the application of original IMERG data used directly in the HEC-HMS hydrological model had much lower accuracy than that of gauged data and merged data. The simulation using the merged precipitation in HEC-HMS exhibited much better performances than gauged data. The mean NSE improved from 0.84 to 0.87 for calibration and 0.80 to 0.84 for verification, while the lower NSE improved from 0.81 to 0.84 for calibration and 0.73 to 0.86 for verification, which showed that accuracy and robustness were both significantly improved. Results of this study indicate the advances of remote sensing precipitation with deep learning for flash flood forecasting in mountainous regions. It is likely that more significant improvements can be made in flash flood forecasting by employing multi-source remote sensing products and deep learning merging methods considering the impact of complex terrain. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Floods have brought a great threat to the life and property of human beings. Under the premise of strengthening flood control engineering measures and following the strategic thinking of sustainable development, many achievements have been made in flood forecasting recently. How-ever, due to the complexity of the traditional lumped model and distributed model, the hydrologic parameter calibration process is full of difficulties, leading to a long development cycle of a reason-able hydrologic prediction model. Even for modern data-driven models, the spatial distribution characteristics of the rainfall data are also not fully mined. Based on this situation, this paper abstracts the rainfall data into the graph structure data, uses remote sensing images to extract the elevation information, introduces the graph attention mechanism to extract the spatial characteristics of rainfall, and employs long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) network to fuse the spatial and temporal characteristics for flood prediction. Through well-designed experiments, the forecasting effect of flood peak value and flood arrival time is verified. Furthermore, compared with the LSTM model and BIGRU model without spatial feature extraction, the advantages of spatiotemporal feature fusion are highlighted. The specific performance is that the RMSE (the root means square error) and R2 (coefficient of determination) of the GA-RNN model have been significantly improved. Finally, we conduct experiments on the observed ten rainfall events in the history of the target watershed. According to the hydrological prediction specifications, the model can be evaluated as a Class B flood forecasting model. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Accurate load forecasting is challenging due to the significant uncertainty of load demand. Deep reinforcement learning, which integrates the nonlinear fitting ability of deep learning with the decision-making ability of reinforcement learning, has obtained effective solutions to various optimization problems. However, no study has been reported, which used deep reinforcement learning for short-term load forecasting because of the difficulties in handling the high temporal correlation and high convergence instability. In this study, a novel asynchronous deep reinforcement learning model is proposed for short-term load forecasting by addressing the above difficulties. First, a new asynchronous deep deterministic policy gradient method is proposed to disrupt the temporal correlation of different samples to reduce the overestimation of the expected total discount reward of the agent. Further, a new adaptive early forecasting method is proposed to reduce the time cost of model training by adaptively judging the training situation of the agent. Moreover, a new reward incentive mechanism is proposed to stabilize the convergence of model training by taking into account the trend of agent actions at different time steps. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves higher forecasting accuracy, less time cost, and more stable convergence compared with eleven baseline models. © 2021

AB  - Accurate long-term streamflow and flood forecasting have always been an important research direction in hydrology research. Nowadays, climate change, floods, and other anomalies occurring more and more frequently and bringing great losses to society. The prediction of streamflow, especially flood prediction, is important for disaster prevention. Current hydrological models based on physical mechanisms can give accurate predictions of streamflow, but the effective prediction period is only about 1 month in advance, which is too short for decision making. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great potential for predicting runoff and is not only good at handling non-linear data but can also make long-period forecasts. However, most of ANN models are unstable in their predictions when faced with raw flow data, and have excessive errors in predicting extreme flows. Previous studies have shown a link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the streamflow of the Yangtze River. In this paper, we use ENSO and the monthly streamflow data of the Yangtze River from 1952 to 2018 to predict the monthly streamflow of the Yangtze River in two extreme flood years and a small flood year by using deep neural networks. In this paper, three deep neural network frameworks are used: stacked long short-term memory, Conv long short-term memory encoder–decoder long short-term memory and Conv long short-term memory encoder–decoder gate recurrent unit. The results show that the use of ConvLSTM improves the stability of the model and increases the accuracy of the flood prediction. Besides, the introduction of ENSO to the experimental data resulted in a more accurate prediction of the time of the occurrence of flood peaks and flood flows. Furthermore, the best results were obtained on the convolutional long short-term memory + encoder–decoder gate recurrent unit model. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Using machine learning for pluvial flood prediction tasks has gained growing attention in the past years. In particular, data-driven models using artificial neuronal networks show promising results, shortening the computation times of physically based simulations. However, recent approaches have used mainly conventional fully connected neural networks which were (a) restricted to spatially uniform precipitation events and (b) limited to a small amount of input data. In this work, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network has been developed to predict pluvial flooding caused by nonlinear spatial heterogeny rainfall events. The model developed, floodGAN, is based on an image-to-image translation approach whereby the model learns to generate 2D inundation predictions conditioned by heterogenous rainfall distributions—through the minimax game of two adversarial networks. The training data for the floodGAN model was generated using a physically based hydrodynamic model. To evaluate the performance and accuracy of the floodGAN, model multiple tests were conducted using both synthetic events and a historic rainfall event. The results demonstrate that the proposed floodGAN model is up to 106 times faster than the hydrodynamic model and promising in terms of accuracy and generalizability. Therefore, it bridges the gap between detailed flood modelling and real-time applications such as end-to-end early warning systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Establishing a model predicting river flow can effectively reduce huge losses caused by floods. This paper proposes a multi-step time series forecasting model based on multiple input and multiple output strategies, and this model is applied to the flood forecasting process of a river basin in Shanxi, which effectively improves the engineering application value of the flood forecasting model based on deep learning. The experimental results show that after considering the seasonal characteristics of the river channel and screening the influencing factors, a simple neural network model can accurately predict the peak value, the peak time and flood trends. On this basis, we proposed the MSBP (Multi-step Back Propagation) model, which can accurately predict the flow trend of the river basin 20 h in advance, and the NSE (Nash Efficiency) is 0.89. The MSBP model can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the internal interpretability of the model, which is of great significance for effectively improving the effect of flood forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Intelligent flood forecasting systems provide an effective means to forecast flood disaster. Accurate flood flow value prediction is a huge challenge since it's influenced by both spatial and temporal relationship among flood factors. Popular deep learning structures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network lacks abilities of modeling the spatial correlations of hydrological data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. Moreover, not all the temporal information is always valuable for flood forecasting. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial and temporal aware Graph Convolution Network (ST-GCN) for flood prediction, which is capable to extract spatial-temporal information from raw flood data. Moreover, a temporal attention mechanism is introduced to weight the importance of different time steps, thus involving global temporal information to improve flood prediction accuracy. Compared with the existing methods, results on two self-collected datasets show that ST-GCN greatly improves the prediction performance. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Prominent advances in the field of artificial intelligence during the past decade and the breakthrough of deep learning would be useful for investigating ionospheric weather using ground and space-based ionospheric sensors data. The significance of deep learning algorithms needs to be assessed in forecasting the low latitude ionospheric disturbances (delays) for the global positioning system (GPS) signals. Total electron content (TEC) data sets prepared by taking advantage of GPS satellite radio frequency (RF) signals. This letter provides the application of deep learning models, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a hybrid model that consists of LSTM combined with convolution neural network (CNN) to forecast the ionospheric delays for GPS signals. The deep learning models implemented using the vertical TEC (VTEC) time-series data estimated from GPS measurements over Bengaluru, Guntur, and Lucknow GPS stations. The LSTM-CNN model performs well when compared to other ionospheric deep learning forecasting algorithms with minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.5 TEC units (TECUs) and a high degree of R{2} = 0.99. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Flood probability maps are essential for a range of applications, including land use planning and developing mitigation strategies and early warning systems. This study describes the potential application of two architectures of deep learning neural networks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), for spatially explicit prediction and mapping of flash flood probability. To develop and validate the predictive models, a geospatial database that contained records for the historical flood events and geo-environmental characteristics of the Golestan Province in northern Iran was constructed. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) was employed to investigate the spatial interplay between floods and different influencing factors. The CNN and RNN models were trained using the SWARA weights and validated using the receiver operating characteristics technique. The results showed that the CNN model (AUC = 0.832, RMSE = 0.144) performed slightly better than the RNN model (AUC = 0.814, RMSE = 0.181) in predicting future floods. Further, these models demonstrated an improved prediction of floods compared to previous studies that used different models in the same study area. This study showed that the spatially explicit deep learning neural network models are successful in capturing the heterogeneity of spatial patterns of flood probability in the Golestan Province, and the resulting probability maps can be used for the development of mitigation plans in response to the future floods. The general policy implication of our study suggests that design, implementation, and verification of flood early warning systems should be directed to approximately 40% of the land area characterized by high and very susceptibility to flooding. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the intensity and frequency of storm events are projected to increase due to climate change, local agencies urgently need a timely and reliable framework for flood forecasting, downscale from watershed to street level in urban areas. Integrated with property data with various hydrometeorological data, the flood prediction model can also provide further insight into environmental justice, which will aid households and government agencies' decision-making. This study uses deep learning (DL) methods and radar-based rainfall data to predict the inundated areas and analyze the property quickly and demographic data concerning stream proximity to provide a way to quantify socioeconomic impacts. We expect that our DL-based models will improve the accuracy of forecasting floods and provide a better picture of which communities bear the worst burdens of flooding, and encourage city officials to address the underlying causes of flood risk. © 2021 IEEE.

People who live in low-level areas and people who are living near the water resource area such as lakes, dams, river, and other water reservoirs these areas are worst affected by the flood every year. It is due to improper planning in constructing a building as well as other public constructions (i.e proper sewage system or drainage system). There are many reasons how floods occur but these two reasons are the most important reason because floods are occurred due to heavy rain. However, in today's situation even moderate rainfall cause flood due to there is no space for the rainwater to drain or reach the coastal area. This work aims to identify these areas which may face damages due to flood. Furthermore, it provides information as well as decides whether the particular area is safe from damages due to flood. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Floods are a complex phenomenon that is difficult to predict because of their non-linear and dynamic nature. Gauging stations that transmit measured data to the server are often placed in very harsh and far environments that make the risk of missing data so high. The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time reliable flood monitoring and detection system using deep learning. This paper proposed an Internet of Things (IoT) approach for utilizing LoRaWAN as a reliable, low power, wide area communication technology by considering the effect of radius and transmission rate on packet loss. Besides, we evaluate an artificial neural network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network models for flood forecasting. The data from 2013 to 2019 were collected from four gauging stations at Brandywine-Christina watershed, Pennsylvania. Our results show that the deep learning models are more accurate than the physical and statistical models. These results can help to provide and implement flood detection systems that would be able to predict floods at rescue time and reduce financial, human, and infrastructural damage. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This paper is derived from a keynote talk given at the Google's 2020 Flood Forecasting Meets Machine Learning Workshop. Recent experiments applying deep learning to rainfall-runoff simulation indicate that there is significantly more information in large-scale hydrological data sets than hydrologists have been able to translate into theory or models. While there is a growing interest in machine learning in the hydrological sciences community, in many ways, our community still holds deeply subjective and nonevidence-based preferences for models based on a certain type of “process understanding” that has historically not translated into accurate theory, models, or predictions. This commentary is a call to action for the hydrology community to focus on developing a quantitative understanding of where and when hydrological process understanding is valuable in a modeling discipline increasingly dominated by machine learning. We offer some potential perspectives and preliminary examples about how this might be accomplished. © 2020. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Identifying floods and producing flood susceptibility maps are crucial steps for decision-makers to prevent and manage disasters. Plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps. Nevertheless, most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods. In this study, we propose a local spatial sequential long short-term memory neural network (LSS-LSTM) for flood susceptibility prediction in Shangyou County, China. The three main contributions of this study are summarized below. First of all, it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of LSTM for flood susceptibility prediction. Second, we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with LSTM to predict flood susceptibility. Third, we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method. The LSS-LSTM method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data, but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSS-LSTM method achieves satisfactory prediction performance (93.75% and 0.965) in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - With the advancement of water conservancy informatization based on Internet of Things (IoT), the hydrological data are increasingly enriched. As a result, more and more algorithms and methods relying on deep learning are introduced in the flood forecasting. Considering the ability of deep learning on complex features extraction, we proposed a flood process forecasting model based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with two-dimension (2D) convolutional operation. At first, we imported the rainfall spatial–temporal features by gridding the Xixian basin. After that, we processed the data from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as the geographical feature and employed the historical streamflow process of Xixian basin as the trend feature. Next, extensive experiments were implemented to determine the optimal hyper-parameters of the proposed CNN flood process forecasting model. Numerical results show that our proposed model demonstrated a better accuracy for predicting the flood peak and arrival occasion, with a 24-hour and 36-hour lead time respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate runoff prediction is one of the important tasks in various fields such as agriculture, hydrology, and environmental studies. Recently, with massive improvements of computational system and hardware, the deep learning-based approach has recently been applied for more accurate runoff prediction. In this study, the long short-term memory model with sequence-to-sequence structure was applied for hourly runoff predictions from 2015 to 2019 in the Russian River basin, California, USA. The proposed model was used to predict hourly runoff with lead time of 1–6 h using runoff data observed at upstream stations. The model was evaluated in terms of event-based performance using the statistical metrics including root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, peak runoff error, and peak time error. The results show that proposed model outperforms support vector machine and conventional long short-term memory models. In addition, the model has the best predictive ability for runoff events, which means that it can be effective for developing short-term flood forecasting and warning systems. The results of this study demonstrate that the deep learning-based approach for hourly runoff forecasting has high predictive power and sequence-to-sequence structure is effective method to improve the prediction results. © 2021 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the world, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions. Flood forecasting is therefore a vitally important endeavor, typically achieved using physical water flow simulations, which rely on accurate terrain elevation maps. However, such simulations, based on solving partial differential equations, are computationally prohibitive on a large scale. This scalability issue is commonly alleviated using a coarse grid representation of the elevation map, though this representation may distort crucial terrain details, leading to significant inaccuracies in the simulation. Contributions. We train a deep neural network to perform physics-informed downsampling of the terrain map: we optimize the coarse grid representation of the terrain maps, so that the flood prediction will match the fine grid solution. For the learning process to succeed, we configure a dataset specifically for this task. We demonstrate that with this method, it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in computational cost, while maintaining an accurate solution. A reference implementation accompanies the paper as well as documentation and code for dataset reproduction. © 2021 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Though flooding is seen as a common environmental threat globally, it has dramatically increased recently due to climate change, impacting underdeveloped and developing countries dangerously. For example, in most developing countries like Ghana, flooding has affected over four million people in terms of property damage, loss of lives, income and spread of diseases, resulting in economic harm beyond USD780 million. At least one major flood disaster does occur yearly. The recurring incidences of flooding and associated calamitous socio-economic risks and anticipated increase of its prevalence soon in cities of developing countries such as Ghana have necessitated an intelligence system to offer efficient and early warning of its occurrence. In this study, we explore the potential of the machine learning (ML) computing paradigm to propose a flooding prediction model. Specifically, four state-of-the-art ML algorithms, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF) and extremely randomised trees (Extra Trees), are used to implement four different flood prediction models. We measure the performance of our developed models with multiple statistical performance evaluators. The experimental results show the potential of the developed models for efficient and effective prediction of flooding. The merit of this study lies in the fact that it is the first to the best of our knowledge to use a combination of environmental factors from Ghana and machine learning algorithms to develop intelligent flood models to help stakeholders make informed decisions. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Coronavirus COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus recently found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and then widespread outbreak worldwide. As the world struggles to slow the spread of COVID19, some natural disasters coincided with COVID-19 pandemic impacts in many regions of the world. In general, the coincidence of natural disasters with pandemics leads to a worsening of the crisis in terms of the spread of the pandemic and the number of injuries and facing the disaster and the required urgent exceptional procedures. Therefore, there is a great need for predictive intelligence models that forecast the time, place, and magnitude of the disaster. The natural disaster predictive model’s inclusion could enhance the strategies approach to facing the disaster by raising the degree of preparedness that reduces risks and prepares with the necessary resources-implementing the procedures that increase the degree of preventive measures to combat the pandemic spread before the occurrence of predicted natural disasters. This chapter adopts a statistical analysis approach to present some of the natural disasters concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic and their negative effects on the increase in infection with the COVID-19. Besides the statistical analysis approach, the literature review of Deep Learning (DL) applications in natural disaster prediction is presented. The chapter concludes with recommendations that allow intensifying contingency planning procedures by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that can significantly predict natural disasters. Our recommendations may also help the governments develop strategies for risk reduction of natural disasters and reduce the spread of COVID-19. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Efficient, robust, and accurate early flood warning is a pivotal decision support tool that can help save lives and protect the infrastructure in natural disasters. This research builds a hybrid deep learning (ConvLSTM) algorithm integrating the predictive merits of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network to design and evaluate a flood forecasting model to forecast the future occurrence of flood events. Derived from precipitation dataset, the work adopts a Flood Index (IF ), in form of a mathematical representation, to capture the gradual depletion of water resources over time, employed in a flood monitoring system to determine the duration, severity, and intensity of any flood situation. The newly designed predictive model utilizes statistically significant lagged IF , improved by antecedent and real-time rainfall data to forecast the next daily IF value. The performance of the proposed ConvLSTM model is validated against 9 different rainfall datasets in flood prone regions in Fiji which faces flood-driven devastations almost annually. The results illustrate the superiority of ConvLSTM-based flood model over the benchmark methods, all of which were tested at the 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, and the 14-day forecast horizon. For instance, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the study sites were 0.101, 0.150, 0.211 and 0.279 for the four forecasted periods, respectively, using ConvLSTM model. For the next best model, the RMSE values were 0.105, 0.154, 0.213 and 0.282 in that same order for the four forecast horizons. In terms of the difference in model performance for individual stations, the Legate-McCabe Efficiency Index (LME) were 0.939, 0.898, 0.832 and 0.726 for the four forecast horizons, respectively. The results demonstrated practical utility of ConvLSTM in accurately forecasting IF and its potential use in disaster management and risk mitigation in the current phase of extreme weather events. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have steadily been pushing for the construction of stream-oriented smart cities, breaking away from the existing old-town-centered development in the past. Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Regarding urban flooding issues, applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies can provide a timely prediction of imminent incidences of flash floods. The study aims to develop and deploy an effective real-time pluvial flood forecasting AI platform. The platform integrates rainfall hyetographs embedded with uncertainty analyses as well as hydrological and hydraulic modeling. It establishes a large number synthetic of torrential rainfall events and their simulated flooding datasets. The obtained data contain 6000 sets of color-classified rainfall hyetograph maps and 300,000 simulated flooding maps (water depth) in an urban district. The generated datasets are utilized for AI image processing. Through the AI deep learning classifications, the rainfall hyetograph map feature parameters are detected and extracted. The trained features are applied to predict potential rainfall events, recognize their potential inundated water depths as well as display flooding maps in real-time. The performance assessments of the platform are evaluated by Root Means Square Error (RMSE), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSCE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results of RMSE and NSCE indicators illustrate that the methodologies and approaches of the AI platform are reliable and acceptable. However, the values of MAPE show inconsistency. Ultimately, the platform can perform and be utilized promptly in real-time and ensure sufficient lead time in order to prevent possible flooding hazards. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Iran experiences frequent destructive floods with significant socioeconomic consequences. Quantifying the accurate impacts of such natural hazards, however, is a complicated task. The present study uses a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithm, which is among the newer and most powerful algorithms in big data sets, to develop a flood susceptibility map for Iran. A total of 2769 records were collected from flood locations across the entire country; we divided this data set into two groups using a cross-validation technique. The first group, used as a training data set, was constructed from 70% of the data set and was used for model building. The second group, used as a testing data set, was constructed from the remaining 30% of the records and used for validation. Ten flood conditioning factors, slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, geology, land use, distance from roads, and distance from rivers, were identified and used in the modeling process. The area under the prediction-rate curve was used for model evaluation, with results showing that the flood susceptibility map has an acceptable accuracy of 75%. The results also indicated that approximately 12% and 3% of the country are highly and very highly susceptible to future flooding events, respectively. Moreover, 29% and 49% of Iran's cities are located in areas with high and very high susceptibility to future flooding hazards. The most effective approaches to flood mitigation are preventing urban expansion and new construction in highly to very highly flood-prone areas as well as watershed management plans and constructing flood control structures according to the topographical characteristics of the catchment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents a review of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the context of geohazards. The pluri-disciplinary role of UAVs is outlined in numerous studies associated with mass earth movements, volcanology, flooding events and earthquakes. Scientific advances and innovations of several research teams around the world are presented from pre-events investigations to crisis management. More particularly, we emphasize the actual status of technology, methodologies and different applications that have emerged with the use of UAVs for each domain. It is shown that the deployment of UAVs in the geohazards context has experienced a tremendous increase during the last 10 years, with the development of more and more miniaturized, flexible and reliable systems. The use of such technology (UAV platform, instrumentation, methodologies) is different for each domain, depending on the spatial extent and the time scale of the observed phenomenon, but also on the practical constraints associated with the civil aviation agencies regulations (outside or within urban areas, before or during a crisis…). This paper also highlights the use of recent methodologies associated with semi-automatic/automatic segmentation or deep learning for the processing of important amounts of data provided by UAVs. Finally, although still sparse, the joint use of UAVs and satellite data is progressing and remains a challenge for future studies in the context of geohazards. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Among many natural hazards, flood disasters are the most incisive, causing tremendous casualties, in-depth injury to human life, property losses and agriculture, therefore affected the socioeconomic system of the area. Contributing to disaster risk reduction and the property damage associated with floods, the research on the advancement of flood modelling and forecasting is increasingly essential. Flood forecasting technique is one of the most significant current discussion in hydrological-engineering area, in which a highly complex system and difficult to model. The past decade has been seen the rapid development of machine learning techniques contributed extremely within the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and efficient solutions. This paper proposes a framework design of flood forecasting model utilizing committee machine learning methods. Previously published works employing committee machine techniques in the analysis of the robustness of the model, effectiveness, and accuracy are particularly investigated on the used in various subjects. It is found that artificial neural networks, hybridizations, and model optimization are reported as the most effective ways for the improved development of machine learning methods. The proposed framework employs four representative intelligent systems as individual members, including radial basis neural networks, adaptive-neuro fuzzy, support vector machine and deep learning networks to construct a committee machine. As a conclusion, this committee machine with intelligent systems appears to be capable of enhancing the designing of flood forecasting model for disaster risk reduction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are state of the art technique for time-series sequence learning. They are less commonly applied to the hydrological engineering area especially for river water level time-series data for flood warning and forecasting systems. This paper examines an LSTM network for forecasting the river water level in Klang river basin, Malaysia. The river water level contains of two features dimension and one time-series observed data, in this study, prediction responses for river water level data using a trained recurrent neural network and update the network state function is applied. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) in order to get comparison of the generalization solving problem also performed. The performance indicates with the root mean square error, RMSE 0.0253 and coefficient of determination value, R2 0.9815 are closely accurate when updating the network state compared with the RBFNN results. These results verified that the LSTM network with specified training set options is a promising alternative technique to the solution of flood modelling and forecasting problems. © 2020 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

AB  - Data-driven models using an artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning (DL) and numerical models are applied in flood analysis of the urban watershed, which has a complex drainage system. In particular, data-driven models using neural networks can quickly present the results and be used for flood forecasting. However, not a lot of data with actual flood history and heavy rainfalls are available, it is difficult to conduct a preliminary analysis of flood in urban areas. In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) was used to predict the total accumulative overflow, and because of the insufficiency of observed rainfall data, 6 h of rainfall were surveyed nationwide in Korea. Statistical characteristics of each rainfall event were used as input data for the DNN. The target value of the DNN was the total accumulative overflow calculated from StormWater Management Model (SWMM) simulations, and the methodology of data augmentation was applied to increase the input data. The SWMM is one-dimensional model for rainfall-runoff analysis. The data augmentation allowed enrichment of the training data for DNN. The data augmentation was applied ten times for each input combination, and the practicality of the data augmentation was determined by predicting the total accumulative overflow over the testing data and the observed rainfall. The prediction result of DNN was compared with the simulated result obtained using the SWMM model, and it was confirmed that the predictive performance was improved on applying data augmentation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - To date, physical, numerical or data-driven models have been used to forecast water surface elevation in rivers for specific times or locations in the literature. Recently, the trend of forecasting water surface elevation changed from physical and numerical models to data-driven models with the help of the development of big data processing technology and fast simulating time of data-driven models. In this study, a data-driven model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was developed using TensorFlow, one of the famous deep learning frameworks and forecasting of water surface elevation affected tidal river was performed in Hangang River, Korea. From many types of field measurements, the hourly hydrological data, precipitation, outlet discharge of dam upstream and tidal levels were selected as the input dataset through a t-test and a p-value. In particular, the hybrid activation function was proposed to alleviate the vanishing gradient and dying neuron problems generally issued in the application of the activation function. The model showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) and peak error (PE) decreased by 0.22-0.25 m and 0.11-0.21 m, respectively, and the Nash-Sutcliffe effciency (NSE) increased up to 79.3%-97.0% compared with the single activation functions. For w1 = 0.6 and w2 = 0.4 in the hybrid activation function, the improvement of accuracy and the enhancement of the application range of the leading time interval were obtained through a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, the hybrid activation function showed a good performance. The forecasting results provided by this model can be used as reference data for the establishment of the emergency action plan (EAP). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, climate change has been responsible for many flood disasters. It is essential that protective measures should be developed against these. One of these measures is a flood forecasting system in which rising water-levels in rivers are predicted ahead of time. Although several researchers have applied artificial intelligence, and especially deep learning technology, to flood prediction, there is a lack of clarity regarding which deep learning approach is most effective in flood prediction. This study aimed to investigate the prediction of floods from water-level data by using a deep learning approach with data collected from the Kinu River. We adopted the LSTM (long short-term memory) algorithm, which is a type of recurrent neural network that readily reflects time-series data. In this study, we collected water-level data from five stations on the Kinu River, a branch of the Tone River, Japan. The results indicate that it is possible to utilize water-levels to predict flood events with a high level of accuracy. © 2020 22nd Congress of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research-Asia Pacific Division, IAHR-APD 2020: "Creating Resilience to Water-Related Challenges".

AB  - Pluvial floods are rare and dangerous disasters that have a small duration but a destructive impact in most countries. In recent years, the deep learning model has played a significant role in operational flood management areas such as flood forecasting and flood warnings. This paper employed a deep learningbased model to predict the water level flood phenomenon of a river in Taiwan. We combine the advantages of the CNN model and the GRU model and connect the output of the CNN model to the input of the GRU model, called Conv-GRU neural network, and our experiments showed that the Conv-GRU neural network could extract complex features of the river water level. We compared the predictions of several neural network architectures commonly used today. The experimental results indicated that the Conv-GRU model outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. We used the Conv-GRU model for anomaly/fault detection in a time series using open data. The efficacy of this approach was demonstrated on 27 river water level station datasets. Data from Typhoon Soudelor in 2015 were investigated by our model using the anomaly detection method. The experimental results showed our proposed method could detect abnormal water levels effectively. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, India is one of the worst flood-affected countries in the world, with the recent disaster in Kerala in August 2018 being a prime example. A good amount of work has been carried out by employing Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) techniques in the past for flood occurrence based on rainfall, humidity, temperature, water flow, water level etc. However, the challenge is that no one has attempted the possibility of occurrence of flood based on temperature and rainfall intensity. So accordingly Deep Neural Network has been employed for predicting the occurrence of flood based on temperature and rainfall intensity. In addition, a deep learning model is compared with other machine learning models (support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Naïve Bayes) in terms of accuracy and error. The results indicate that the deep neural network can be efficiently used for flood forecasting with highest accuracy based on monsoon parameters only before flood occurrence. © IWA Publishing 2020.

AB  - Machine learning-based data-driven models have achieved great success since their invention. Nowadays, the artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning methods have made great progress than ever before, such as the deep learning and reinforcement learning, etc. In this study, we coupled the ANN with the K-nearest neighbor method to propose a novel hybrid machine learning (HML) hydrological model for flood forecast purpose. The advantage of the proposed model over traditional neural network models is that it can predict discharge continuously without accuracy loss owed to its specially designed model structure. In order to overcome the local minimum issue of the traditional neural network training, a genetic algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt-based multi-objective training method was also proposed. Real-world applications of the HML hydrological model indicated its satisfactory performance and reliable stability, which enlightened the possibility of further applications of the HML hydrological model in flood forecast problems. © 2020 Guangyuan Kan et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.

AB  - Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology. ©2020. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Flood is one of the most disruptive natural hazards, responsible for loss of lives and damage to properties. A number of cities are subject to monsoons influences and hence face the disaster almost every year. Early notification of flood incident could benefit the authorities and public to devise both short and long terms preventive measures, to prepare evacuation and rescue mission, and to relieve the flood victims. Geographical locations of affected areas and respective severities, for instances, are among the key determinants in most flood administration. Thus far, an effective means of anticipating flood in advance remains lacking. Existing tools were typically based on manually input and prepared data. The processes were tedious and thus prohibitive for real-time and early forecasts. Furthermore, these tools did not fully exploit more comprehensive information available in current big data platforms. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel flood forecasting system based on fusing meteorological, hydrological, geospatial, and crowdsource big data in an adaptive machine learning framework. Data intelligence was driven by state-of-the-art learning strategies. Subjective and objective evaluations indicated that the developed system was able to forecast flood incidents, happening in specific areas and time frames. It was also later revealed by benchmarking experiments that the system configured with an MLP ANN gave the most effective prediction, with correct percentage, Kappa, MAE and RMSE of 97.93, 0.89, 0.01 and 0.10, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Reservoir inflow forecasting is extremely important for the management of a reservoir. In practice, accurate forecasting depends on the feature learning performance. To better address this issue, this paper proposed a feature-enhanced regression model (FER), which combined stack autoencoder (SAE) with long short-term memory (LSTM). This model had two constituents: (1) The SAE was constructed to learn a representation as close as possible to the original inputs. Through deep learning, the enhanced feature could be captured sufficiently. (2) The LSTM was established to simulate the mapping between the enhanced features and the outputs. Under recursive modeling, the patterns of correlation in the short term and dependence in the long term were considered comprehensively. To estimate the performance of the FER model, two historical daily discharge series were investigated, i.e., the Yangtze River in China and the Sava Dolinka River in Slovenia. The proposed model was compared with other machine-learning methods (i.e., the LSTM, SAE-based neural network, and traditional neural network). The results demonstrated that the proposed FER model yields the best forecasting performance in terms of six evaluation criteria. The proposed model integrates the deep learning and recursive modeling, and thus being beneficial to exploring complex features in the reservoir inflow forecasting. Moreover, for smaller catchments with significant torrential characteristics, more data are needed (e.g., at least 20 years) to effectively train the model and to obtain accurate flood-forecasting results. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Recently accrued attention has been given to machine learning approaches for flooding prediction. However, most of these studies focused mainly on time-series flooding prediction at specified sensors, rarely on spatio-temporal prediction of inundations. In this work, an integrated long short-term memory (LSTM) and reduced order model (ROM) framework has been developed. This integrated LSTM-ROM has the capability of representing the spatio-temporal distribution of floods since it takes advantage of both ROM and LSTM. To reduce the dimensional size of large spatial datasets in LSTM, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches are introduced. The LSTM training and prediction processes are carried out over the reduced space. This leads to an improvement of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy. The performance of the LSTM-ROM developed here has been evaluated using Okushiri tsunami as test cases. The results obtained from the LSTM-ROM have been compared with those from the full model (Fluidity). In predictive analytics, it is shown that the results from both the full model and LSTM-ROM are in a good agreement whilst the CPU cost using the LSTM-ROM is decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to full model simulations. Additionally, prescriptive analytics has been undertaken to estimate the uncertainty in flood induced conditions. Given the time series of the free surface height at a specified detector, the corresponding induced wave conditions along the coastline have then been provided using the LSTM network. Promising results indicate that the use of LSTM-ROM can provide the flood prediction in seconds, enabling us to provide real-time predictions and inform the public in a timely manner, reducing injuries and fatalities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forecasting flood inundation in urban areas is challenging due to the lack of validation data. Recent developments have led to new genres of data sources, such as images and videos from smartphones and CCTV cameras. If the reference dimensions of objects, such as bridges or buildings, in images are known, the images can be used to estimate water levels using computer vision algorithms. Such algorithms employ deep learning and edge detection techniques to identify the water surface in an image, which can be used as additional validation data for forecasting inundation. In this study, a methodology is presented for flood inundation forecasting that integrates validation data generated with the assistance of computer vision. Six equifinal models are run simultaneously, one of which is selected for forecasting based on a goodness-of-fit (least error), estimated using the validation data. Collection and processing of images is done offline on a regular basis or following a flood event. The results show that the accuracy of inundation forecasting can be improved significantly using additional validation data. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Short-term Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting is important for flood forecasting, early flood warning, and natural hazard management. This study proposes a precipitation forecast model by extrapolating Cloud-Top Brightness Temperature (CTBT) using advanced Deep Neural Networks, and applying the forecasted CTBT into an effective rainfall retrieval algorithm to obtain the Short-term Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (0–6 hr). To achieve such tasks, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), respectively. The precipitation forecasts obtained from our proposed framework, (i.e., LSTM combined with PERSIANN) are compared with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Persistency method, and Farneback optical flow each combined with PERSIANN algorithm and the numerical model results from the first version of Rapid Refresh (RAPv1.0) over three regions in the United States, including the states of Oregon, Oklahoma, and Florida. Our experiments indicate better statistics, such as correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error, for the CTBT forecasts from the proposed LSTM compared to the RNN, Persistency, and the Farneback method. The precipitation forecasts from the proposed LSTM and PERSIANN framework has demonstrated better statistics compared to the RAPv1.0 numerical forecasts and PERSIANN estimations from RNN, Persistency, and Farneback projections in terms of Probability of Detection, False Alarm Ratio, Critical Success Index, correlation coefficient, and root-mean-square error, especially in predicting the convective rainfalls. The proposed method shows superior capabilities in short-term forecasting over compared methods, and has the potential to be implemented globally as an alternative short-term forecast product. ©2018.

AB  - Considering the high random and non-static property of the rainfall-runoff process, lots of models are being developed in order to learn about such a complex phenomenon. Recently, Machine learning techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other networks have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modelling as well as for other fields of hydrology. However, deep learning methods such as the state-of-the-art for LSTM networks are little studied in hydrological sequence time-series predictions. We deployed ANN and LSTM network models for simulating the rainfall-runoff process based on flood events from 1971 to 2013 in Fen River basin monitored through 14 rainfall stations and one hydrologic station in the catchment. The experimental data were from 98 rainfall-runoff events in this period. In between 86 rainfall-runoff events were used as training set, and the rest were used as test set. The results show that the two networks are all suitable for rainfall-runoff models and better than conceptual and physical based models. LSTM models outperform the ANN models with the values of R2 and NSE beyond 0.9, respectively. Considering different lead time modelling the LSTM model is also more stable than ANN model holding better simulation performance. The special units of forget gate makes LSTM model better simulation and more intelligent than ANN model. In this study, we want to propose new data-driven methods for flood forecasting. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - To study the Dongting Lake water level variation and its relationship with the upstream Three Gorges Dam (TGD), a deep learning method based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to establish a model that predicts the daily water levels of Dongting Lake. Seven factors are used as the input for the LSTM model and eight years of daily data (from 2003 to 2012) are used to train the model. Then, the model is applied to the test dataset (from 2011 to 2013) for forecasting and is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). The test shows the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to the support vector machine (SVM) model. Furthermore, the model is adjusted to simulate the situation where the TGD does not exist to explore the dam's impact. The experiment shows that the water level of Dongting Lake drops conspicuously every year from September to November during the TGD impounding period, and the water level increases mildly during dry seasons due to TGD replenishment. Additionally, the impact of the TGD results in a water level decline in Dongting Lake during flood peaks and a subsequent lagged rise. This research provides a tool for flood forecasting and offers a reference for TGD water regulation. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely applied in flood forecasting and got good results. However, it can still not go beyond one or two hidden layers for the problematic non-convex optimization. This paper proposes a deep learning approach by integrating stacked autoencoders (SAE) and back propagation neural networks (BPNN) for the prediction of stream flow, which simultaneously takes advantages of the powerful feature representation capability of SAE and superior predicting capacity of BPNN. To further improve the non-linearity simulation capability, we first classify all the data into several categories by the K-means clustering. Then, multiple SAE-BP modules are adopted to simulate their corresponding categories of data. The proposed approach is respectively compared with the support-vector-machine (SVM) model, the BP neural network model, the RBF neural network model and extreme learning machine (ELM) model. The experimental results show that the SAE-BP integrated algorithm performs much better than other benchmarks. © 2017 IEEE.
