Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of two different light doses when treating AKs with ALA-PDT on the face/scalp. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with two histologically confirmed AKs were enrolled in the within-patient comparison study. ALA-PDT was performed twice with two weeks interval for each AK. Patients were randomized to receive a light dose of 70 or 100 J/cm(2) as their first split face/scalp treatment. Follow-up examinations were carried out at months 3 and 6. Efficacy end point included clinical/histological AK clearance rate. Results: No significant difference in therapeutic efficacy and adverse events of ALA-PDT was found between the two light doses at both follow-up visits. At months 3 and 6 after PDT the rate of complete remission were respectively 100% and 92.1% for 70 J/cm(2), 92.1% and 84.2% for 100 J/cm(2). The adverse events of the treatment were rosacea 5/76 (6.58%), hyperpigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), hypopigmentation 4/76 (5.26%), transient milia 3/76 (3.95%). Conclusions: The topical ALA-PDT with the red light dose of 70 J/cm(2) is an effective treatment for mild and moderate AKs on the face/scalp with expected adverse events of pigmentation changes, rosacea and transient milia",Notes1,10.3109/09546634.2013.848257,keyword1;keyword23,Topical Rapamycin as a Treatment for Fibrofolliculomas in Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Randomized Split-Face Trial,"Gijezen, L.C. and Vernooij, M. and Martens, H. and Oduber, C.E.U. and Henquet, C.J.M. and Starink, T.M. and Prins, M.H. and Menko, F.H. and Nelemans, P.J. and van Steensel, M.A.M.",Plos One,1932-6203,9,6,-,2014,,WOS:000337165600039,"Background: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the occurrence of benign, mostly facial, skin tumours called fibrofolliculomas, multiple lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax and an increased renal cancer risk. Current treatments for fibrofolliculomas have high rates of recurrence and carry a risk of complications. It would be desirable to have a treatment that could prevent fibrofolliculomas from growing. Animal models of BHD have previously shown deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Topical use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is an effective treatment for the skin tumours (angiofibromas) in tuberous sclerosis complex, which is also characterised by mTOR deregulation. In this study we aimed to determine if topical rapamycin is also an effective treatment for fibrofolliculomas in BHD. Methods: We performed a double blinded, randomised, facial left-right controlled trial of topical rapamycin 0.1% versus placebo in 19 BHD patients. Trial duration was 6 months. The primary outcome was cosmetic improvement as measured by doctors and patients. Changes in fibrofolliculoma number and size were also measured, as was occurrence of side effects. Results: No change in cosmetic status of fibrofolliculomas was reported in the majority of cases for the rapamycin treated (79% by doctors, 53% by patients) as well as the placebo treated facial sides (both 74%). No significant differences between rapamycin and placebo treated facial halves were observed (p = 1.000 for doctors opinion, p = 0.344 for patients opinion). No significant difference in fibrofolliculoma number or change in size of the fibrofolliculomas was seen after 6 months. Side effects occurred more often after rapamycin treatment (68% of patients) than after placebo (58% of patients; p = 0.625). A burning sensation, erythema, itching and dryness were most frequently reported. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that treatment of fibrofolliculomas with topical rapamycin in BHD results in cosmetic improvement",Notes1,10.1371/journal.pone.0099071,keyword1;keyword25,Improvement in Facial Erythema Within 30 Minutes of Initial Application of Brimonidine Tartrate in Patients With Rosacea,"Jackson, J.M. and Fowler, J. and Moore, A. and Jarratt, M. and Jones, T. and Meadows, K. and Steinhoff, M. and Rudisill, D. and Leoni, M.",Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,1545-9616 (Print),13,6,699-704,2014,,WOS:000337552500010,"Background: Brimonidine tartrate (BT) 0.5% gel demonstrated significantly greater efficacy versus vehicle gel once-daily for the treatment of moderate to severe erythema of rosacea. Objectives:To assess the 30-minute speed of onset of topical BT 0.5% gel in reducing facial erythema in Phase Ill studies as measured by subject and clinician assessments of erythema. Methods: Two Phase Ill, randomized, controlled studies with identical design in which subjects with moderate erythema of rosacea (study A: n=260; study B: n=293) were randomized 1:1 to apply topical BT 0.5% or vehicle gel once-daily for 4 weeks. Evaluations included severity of erythema based on Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient's Self-Assessment (PSA) prior to study drug application and at 30 minutes after application on days 1, 15, and 29. Results: 97.7% and 96.6% of subjects reported normal study completion for studies A and B, respectively. The percentage of subjects achieving a 1-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA was significantly increased at 30 minutes post-dosing with BT 0.5% gel compared to vehicle gel on visit days (day 1: 279 vs 6.9%, P<0.001; day 15: 55.9 vs 21.1%, P<0.001; Day 29: 58.3 vs 32.0%, P<0.001 for BT 0.5% gel vs vehicle) in study A. Similar results were shown for study B. Conclusions: Once-daily topical BT gel 0.5% is not only efficacious at reducing facial erythema but also exhibits response within 30 minutes of application in a significant number of patients throughout both Phase Ill studies"6,Only Skin Deep: Optimism and Public Self-Consciousness Did Not Associate With the Placebo Response in a Dermatology Clinical Trial,"Garshick, M.K. and Chang, A.L.S. and Kimball, A.B.",Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,1545-9616 (Print),13,6,719-722,2014,,WOS:000337552500013,"Objective: Although not well-understood, dermatologic diseases studied in clinical trials often demonstrate substantial response to placebo. The study objective is to determine if optimism, public self-consciousness and other personality traits predict response to placebo or active treatment in a dermatology clinical trial. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to subjects previously enrolled in a two-center rosacea study who had been randomized to either a treatment or placebo gel. The questionnaire included the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), the Public Self-Consciousness Scale, and questions to assess personality traits. Results: Forty-seven subjects out of 83 (57%) returned the questionnaire, There was no statistically significant difference in the LOT-R score in those who responded to placebo versus those who did not (18.08 vs 1792, P=0.92) nor in those who responded to active treatment versus those who did not (16.27 vs 15.86, P=0.79). There was no statistically significant difference in public-self consciousness among placebo or active treatment responders versus non-responders (11.75 vs 10.67, P=0.66; 13.55 vs 14.45, P=0.68). The placebo responders were more likely to report that they were not unusually sensitive to most drugs/medications (X-2=8.33, P=0.004). Conclusion: Although this pilot study is small, there was no meaningful difference in levels of optimism or public self-consciousness among those who responded to placebo. Placebo responders were more likely to report that they were not sensitive to most drugs/medications, raising the possibility that they are actually less likely to detect when they are on medications"4,"Randomized, Phase 2, Dose-Ranging Study in the Treatment of Rosacea With Encapsulated Benzoyl Peroxide Gel","Leyden, J.J.",Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,1545-9616 (Print),13,6,685-688,2014,,WOS:000337552500008,"Objective: Compare the safety and efficacy of 1% and 5% silica encapsulated benzoyl peroxide (E-BPO) in patients with papulopustular rosacea.

There are no reliable treatment guidelines for acne erythema. Objective: We compared the effect and safety of a nonablative, 1550-nm fractional laser and a 595-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) for the treatment of acne erythema. Materials and methods: Twelve Korean patients with acne erythema were enrolled. Sides of the face were randomized to receive treatment with a fractional laser or a PDL for a total of three treatments at 4-week intervals. The assessment of effectiveness was mean change in mexameter scores, investigator's and patients' clinical assessments. Results: Statistically significant improvements in baseline acne erythema were observed through an improved erythema index on both treated sides. But, the improvements from each laser treatment were not significantly different. Mean scores of investigator assessments were 3.42 +/- 0.67 in fractional laser-treated sites and 3.33 +/- 0.65 in PDL-treated sites. Patients assessed their improvement as good or excellent in 91.7% of fractional laser-treated sites and 75% of PDL-treated sites. Conclusion: Both lasers are effective and safe modalities for the treatment of acne erythema; however, these data suggest better clinical efficacy with the use of a 1550-nm, erbium-glass fractional laser"8,Common Dermatologic Conditions,"Vary, J.C. and O'Connor, K.M.",Medical Clinics of North America,,98,3,445-+,2014,,WOS:000336188500005,"This review discusses common dermatologic presentations as they would appear in a primary care office, exploring the differential diagnoses for each.

They were first widely prescribed by dermatologists in the early 1950s in the treatment of acne. More recently, their biological actions on inflammation, proteolysis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metal chelation, ionophoresis, and bone metabolism were studied. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs have direct or indirect effects on the vascular endothelium and the vascular relaxation/ contraction system. The therapeutic effects of tetracyclines and analogues were studied in rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitisand autoimmune diseases autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. In addition, downregulation of MMP using doxycycline could be beneficial in reducing vascular dysfunction mediated by MMPs and progressive damage of the vascular wall. We review the nonantibiotic properties of doxycycline and its potential clinical applications"10,Objective Assessment of Erythema and Pigmentation of Melasma Lesions and Surrounding Areas in Long-Term Management Regimens With Triple Combination,"Hexsel, D. and Soirefmann, M. and Fernandes, J.D. and Siega, C.",Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,1545-9616 (Print),13,4,444-448,2014,,WOS:000334555800012,"Background: Melasma has a negative impact on quality of life since it typically occurs on the face. Objectives: To evaluate the erythema and pigmentation of melasma lesions and the surrounding areas in patients receiving triple combination (TC: hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide) regimens. Methods: Patients first received an 8-week daily TC treatment and were then randomized to twice weekly or tapering regimen with TC. Melanin and erythema levels of lesions and surrounding areas were objectively measured using a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer. Results: Progressive reduction in the mean melanin levels was observed in the treatment phase. Following both maintenance regimens, there was no difference between melanin levels in the melasma lesions. Adverse effects were rare in both phases of the study and there was borderline reduction in erythema with regimen II. Conclusion: Both maintenance regimens were effective in maintaining results obtained during the initial treatment phase, and were safe and well-tolerated. Erythema was less intense with the tapering regimen"9,What's New in Objective Assessment and Treatment of Facial Hyperpigmentation?,"Molinar, V.E. and Taylor, S.C. and Pandya, A.G.",Dermatologic Clinics,,32,2,123-+,2014,,WOS:000334649200003,"Facial hyperpigmentation is common and challenging to treat in darker-skinned populations.
