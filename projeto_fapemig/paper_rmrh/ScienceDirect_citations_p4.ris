AB  - As the most abundant greenhouse gas, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered one of the main attributors to climate change. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be measured by ground-based monitoring networks, mobile monitoring campaigns, and carbon-observing satellites. However, the worldwide ground-based monitoring networks are composed of sparsely distributed sites and are inadequate to represent the spatiotemporal distributions of CO2. Satellite-based remote sensing features repeated, long-term, and large-scale measurements, so it plays a crucial role in monitoring the global distributions of atmospheric CO2. However, due to the presence of heavy clouds (or aerosols) and the limitation of satellite orbiting tracks, there exist large amounts of missing data in satellite retrievals. Various methods, including chemical transport models (CTMs), geostatistical methods, and regression-based models, have been employed to derive full-coverage spatiotemporal distributions of CO2 based on the limited CO2 measurements. This review summarizes the strengths and limitations of these methods. However, CTMs simulation results can have high uncertainty due to imperfect knowledge of the real world, and the interpolation accuracy of all geostatistical methods is limited by the large amount of data gaps in current satellite retrieved CO2 products. To overcome these limitations, regression-based methods (especially machine learning models) have the ability to predict CO2 with superior predictive performance, so this review also summarizes the framework of the machine learning approach. Leveraging the ongoing advancements of satellite instrumentation, the satellite-based CO2 products have been improving dramatically in recent decades, and this review will describe and critically assess the advantages and disadvantages of the currently used systems in detail. For future improvements, we recommend the fusion of data from multiple satellite retrievals and CTMs by using machine learning algorithms in order to obtain even longer-term, larger-scale, finer-resolution, and higher-accuracy CO2 datasets.

AB  - Water quality index is crucial for improving water quality and clean water supply to achieve sustainable development goals directly related to water, agriculture, biodiversity, health, and climate actions. Water quality index examines the vital relationship between water supply and demand, focusing on the critical role that water quality (WQ) plays in sustainable development and integrated environmental management. This study evaluates the methodology and limitations of several studies by doing a thorough examination of regional and global WQ indices and synthesizing the results. Water Quality Indices (WQIs) have been used to measure WQ since the 1960s, offering a mechanism for changes in WQ at specific needs and environmental challenges. This review study assesses overall water quality using global and regional WQ indexes based on several studies and aims to provide a detailed analysis of various WQIs utilized across the globe. The WQIs stated WQ measurements into a single number, which are categorized as poor, marginal, fair, excellent, and exceptional, to depict changes clearly and understandably in WQ. However, region-specific WQIs are required due to the variety of standards established by national and international organizations, as well as different pollution prevention elements. Thus, there is continual interest in developing exact WQIs suitable for a region or geographic area. Still, structured and in-depth literature analysis is required to examine current WQIs to research, evaluate, and highlight the drawbacks of various methodologies employed in each development phase. This review offers insightful information for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners tackling the ever-changing problems of water quality in the interest of sustainable water resource management. The debate concentrates on various WQI-related topics, such as how multiple WQIs have evolved, what variables define their parameter requirements, what restrictions WQIs have, how widely WQIs are used, and what benefits WQIs have over one another regarding worldwide applicability.

AB  - Recent development of small-scale gold mining activities in Côte d’Ivoire is a serious threat to the environment because of deforestation, soil scrapping, pit mining, over-use of water resources and pollution of surface and ground waters by mercury, cyanides, and acids. The challenge for the governance of this activity is to resolve the tension between the desired development of a small-scale mining activity, which may benefit the local and national economy, and the impacts of this activity on the environment. The regulation of the exploration and exploitation of mining sites and the promotion of best practices was part of the National program for the rationalization of gold-panning in Côte d’Ivoire. The capacity of the government to monitor the expansion of numerous mining sites disseminated all over the country is one of the key aspects for successful implementation of these policies. This study explores the potential value of computer-assisted mapping of artisanal mining sites based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The detection method, using artificial intelligence and training data sets generated during field campaigns, was inspired from a previous experience in Senegal. It was applied to a region of about 600 km2 in Central Côte d’Ivoire. Annual maps of areas affected by the mining activities were produced for the period 2018 – 2021. The areas affected by artisanal mining activities expanded from 3.39 km2 to 8.80 km2 in December 2021, corresponding to an average growth rate of 0.24 km2/month. The temporal and spatial resolution of the Sentinel satellite imagery proved to be useful to map and quantify the expansion rate of artisanal mining sites in Côte d’Ivoire. Recommendations are made for the integration of these tools into plans for the development of small-scale mining activities in Côte d’Ivoire that would be more respectful of the environment and societies.

AB  - This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity. The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc, mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table. The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements. Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks, re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases and remote sensing.

AB  - There is growing evidence that river temperatures are increasing under climate change, which is expected to be exacerbated by increased abstractions to satisfy human water demands. Water temperature research has experienced crucial advances, both in terms of developing new monitoring and modelling tools, as well as understanding the mechanisms of temperature feedbacks with biogeochemical and ecological processes. However, water practitioners and regulators are challenged with translating the widespread and complex technological, modelling and conceptual advances made in river temperature research into improvements in management practice. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the state-of-the-art monitoring and modelling tools available to inform ecological research and practice. In so doing, we identify pressing research gaps and suggest paths forward to address practical research and management challenges. The proposed research directions aim to provide new insights into spatio-temporal stream temperature dynamics and unravel drivers and controls of thermal river regimes, including the impacts of changing temperature on metabolism and aquatic biogeochemistry, as well as aquatic organisms. The findings of this review inform future research into ecosystem resilience in the face of thermal degradation and support the development of new management strategies cutting across spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Water quality improvement is one of the top priorities in the global agenda endorsed by United Nation. In this review manuscript, a holistic view of water quality degradation such as concerned pollutants, source of pollution, and its consequences in major river basins around the globe (at least 1 from each continent and a total of 16 basins) is presented. Additionally, nine contemporary techniques such as field scale evaluation, watershed scale evaluation, strategies to identify critical source areas, optimization strategies for placement of best management practices (BMPs), social component in watershed modeling, machine learning algorithms to address water quality problems in complex natural systems concomitant with spatial heterogeneity, establishing a total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), remote sensing in monitoring water quality, and developing water quality index are discussed. Next, the existing barriers to improve water quality are classified into primary and secondary impediments. A detail discussion of three primary impediments (climate change, urbanization and industrial activities, and agriculture) and ten secondary impediments (availability of water quality data, complexity of system, lack of skilled person, environmental legislation, fragmented mandate, limitation in resources, environmental awareness, resistance to change, alteration of nutrient ratio by river damming, and emerging pollutants) are illustrated. Finally, considering all the existing knowledge gaps pertaining to contemporary strategies, a future direction of water quality research is outlined to significantly improve the water quality around the globe.

AB  - The transformation to a resource-circular bio-economy offers a mechanism to mitigate climate change and environmental degradation. As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables derived from terrestrial, aquatic biomass and waste resources are expected to play significant roles over the next decades. This study provides an overview of potential biomass resources ranging from higher plant species to phototrophic microbial cluster, and their fundamental photosynthesis processes as well as biogeochemical carbon cycles involved in ecosystems. The review reflects empirical advances in conversion technologies and processes to manufacture value-added biorenewables from biomass and waste resources. The nexus perspective of resource-biorenewable-waste has been analysed to understand their interdependency and wider interaction with environmental resources and ecosystems. We further discussed the systems perspectives of biorenewables to develop fundamental understanding of resource flows and carbon cycles across biorenewable subsystems and highlight their spatial and temporal variability. Our in-depth review suggested the system challenges of biorenewable, which are subject to nonlinearity, variability and complexity. To unlock such system complexity and address the challenges, a whole systems approach is necessary to develop fundamental understanding, design novel biorenewable solutions. Our review reflects recent advances and prospects of computational methods for biorenewable systems modelling. This covers the development and applications of first principle models, process design, quantitative evaluation of sustainability and ecosystem services and mathematical optimisation to improve design, operation and planning of processes and develop emerging biorenewable systems. Coupling these advanced computational methods, a whole systems approach enables a multi-scale modelling framework to inherently link the processes and subsystems involved in biomass ecosystems and biorenewable manufacturing. Reviewing modelling advances, our study provides insights into the emerging opportunities in biorenewable research and highlights the frontier research directions, which have the potential to impact biorenewable sector sustainability.

AB  - Gold mining has played a significant role in Ghana's economy for centuries. Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while industrial mining is prevalent in the country, the expansion of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated in recent years. Many of these artisanal mines are not only harmful to human health due to the use of Mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, but also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems, degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region. In this study, the Landsat image archive available through Google Earth Engine was used to quantify the total footprint of vegetation loss due to artisanal gold mines in Ghana from 2005 to 2019 and understand how conversion of forested regions to mining has changed over a decadal period from 2007 to 2017. A combination of machine learning and change detection algorithms were used to calculate different land cover conversions and the timing of conversion annually. Within the study area of southwestern Ghana, our results indicate that approximately 47,000 ha (⨦2218 ha) of vegetation were converted to mining at an average rate of ~2600 ha yr−1. The results indicate that a high percentage (~50%) of this mining occurred between 2014 and 2017. Around 700 ha of this mining occurred within protected areas as mapped by the World Database of Protected Areas. In addition to deforestation, increased artisanal mining activity in recent years has the potential to affect human health, access to drinking water resources and food security. This work expands upon limited research into the spatial footprint of Galamsey in Ghana, complements mapping efforts by local geographers, and will support efforts by the government of Ghana to monitor deforestation caused by artisanal mining.

AB  - Flooding is one of the most widespread and catastrophic natural disasters. The exposure of cropland to floods is directly related to the quality of cropland and food security, so it is particularly important to map the spatiotemporal evolution of this exposure, with a specific focus on longer time series and higher resolution scales. This study is the first of its kind to analyse the worldwide spatiotemporal variability of Cropland Exposure to Flooding (CEF) with the 30 m resolution of Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) dataset during 2000–2019. The findings indicate that: (1) the global CEF area increased by a total of 83,429.50 km2 or 7.75 %, from 2000 to 2019; (2) only North America's CEF showed a downward trend, and the region with the largest increase in CEF was South Asia; (3) the CEF in 23 river basins, including Ganges, Indus, Mississippi, Yangtze, and Danube, accounted for 79.88 % of the global total in 2019P; (4) in 2019P, China had the largest CEF globally, reaching 239,525.07 km2. The fastest growing CEF was India, contributing 16.36 % of the global CEF growth. The CEF of United States experienced a reduction trend; (5) two constructed indicators were used in evaluating the CEF of countries worldwide, and a total of 46 countries are considered to be at the highest level of risk, mainly in Europe and Asia. Based on these conclusions, we carried out a cold/hot spot analysis to reveal the spatial heterogeneity and possible driving factors in this phenomenon, and we offer management suggestions to limit the risks to cropland in the floodplains.

AB  - Accurate estimates of high-spatial-resolution global terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) from Landsat data are crucial for many basic and applied research. Yet current Landsat-derived LE products were developed using single algorithm with large uncertainties and discrepancies. Here we proposed a convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM)-based integrated LE (CNN-LSTM-ILE) framework that integrates five Landsat-derived physical LE algorithms, topography-related variables (elevation, slope and aspect) and eddy covariance (EC) observations to estimate 30-m global terrestrial LE. CNN-LSTM-ILE not only conserves good performance of LE estimation from pure deep learning (DL) algorithm, but partially inherits physical mechanism of the individual physical algorithms for improving the generalization of the integration algorithms for extreme cases. CNN-LSTM is an algorithm that combines two deep learning structures (CNN and LSTM) to effectively utilize the spatial and temporal information contained in the forcing inputs. The data were collected from 190 globally distributed EC observations from 2000 to 2015 and were provided by FLUXNET. The cross-validation results indicated that the CNN-LSTM integration algorithm improved the LE estimates by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) of 5–8 W/m2 and increasing Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.05–0.16 when compared with the individual LE algorithms and the results of three other machine learning integration algorithms (multiple linear regression, MLR; random forest, RF; and deep neural networks, DNN). The CNN-LSTM integration algorithm had highest KGE (0.81) and R2 (0.66) compared to ground-measured and was applied to generate the Landsat-like regional and global terrestrial LE. An innovation of our strategy is that the CNN-LSTM-ILE model integrates pixel proximity effects and daily LE variations to enhance the accuracy of 16-day LE estimations. This approach can produce a more reliable Landsat-like global terrestrial LE product to improve the representativeness of heterogeneous regions for monitoring hydrological variables.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to the strategic planning of the supply chain for lime cultivation. The uncertainty associated with lime production due to factors such as transportation, crime, and water availability, among others, represents different challenges. To address these challenges, the authors propose the use of machine learning tools coupled with deterministic optimization to obtain optimal solutions for the supply chain for future years. This paper highlights the use of justice schemes to ensure an equitable distribution of lime production between farmers and learning machines to quantify the insecurity impact on lime production in Michoacan. The problem can be solved using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that focuses on maximizing economic benefits, minimizing the use of irrigation water in crops, and minimizing Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2eq) emissions within the supply chain. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively address the challenges facing the lime production supply chain, resulting in an optimized and equitable lime production and distribution between farmers using the Social Welfare Justice scheme. Scenario A presents a utopian viewpoint with maximum benefits and minimum CO2eq generated emissions, corresponding to $ 4.08 × 109 and 1.94 × 106 tons of CO2eq, respectively. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in supply chain management, specifically in the optimization of supply chain processes.

AB  - Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are filamentary regions of high moisture content in mid-latitude regions through which most of the poleward moisture is being transported. These ARs carry a huge amount of water in the form of vapor and thus landfalling of these ARs may bring either a beneficial supply of water or may create hazardous flood situations and thus cause damage to life and property. These regions have been statistically characterized as intense integrated water vapor transport (IVT) regions in the troposphere based on various thresholds of magnitude, direction, and geometry. To enhance the knowledge of data-driven methods for modelling nonlinear atmospheric dynamics associated with ARs, a first ever study with data-driven methodology incorporating a Deep Learning architecture, Autoencoder has been proposed. While training the proposed model, the Adam optimizer was used to reduce the mean squared error loss and was optimized using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and Sigmoid activation functions. The prediction results of the availability of ARs at next frames by the Autoencoder were assessed by popularly used performance evaluation metrics structural similarity index metrics (SSMI), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). We have got comparatively higher scores (average) of SSIM (0.739) and PSNR (64.422) and lower scores (average) of RMSE (0.155) and MSE (0.0247) for AR prediction from our model which signifies the accuracy of the proposed Autoencoder in capturing AR dynamics. The findings of the study could be useful in giving important insights to incorporate Deep Learning models for forecasting ARs at significant lead time and consequently reducing the risk and increasing the resilience of AR flood prone regions.

AB  - The computation of the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) using the FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo) requires data on maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax, Tmin), relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (Rs), and wind speed (u2). However, the records of meteorological variables are often incomplete or of poor quality. Frequently, in the mountain areas such as those of the Andes, environmental sensors are subject to harsh conditions, due to the diurnal/nocturnal climatic variability causing challenging conditions for meteorological monitoring, which leads to data loss. For high-elevation landscapes like the Andes, the missing variables of vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation cause a high impact on PM-ETo calculation. To assess these limitations, several methods relying on maximum and minimum temperature to estimate the missing variables have been considered in the present investigation. Based on data from three automatic weather stations in the high Tropical Andes (humid páramo, 3298 – 3955 m a.s.l.), we found that the calibration and validation of methods were essential to estimate Rs. Using the (De Jong and Stewart, 1993) (Rs-DS) method we retrieved the highest performance, a RMSE between 2.89 and 3.81 MJ m−2 day−1. Moreover, In the absence of RH observations, replacing the dew point temperature (Tdew) by Tmin was a reliable alternative, when apply the method of (Allen et al., 1998) (VPD-FAO) which showed the highest performance with RMSE between 0.08 and 0.12 kPa. These results yielded highly accurate PM-ETo estimates, with RMSE between 0.29 and 0.34 mm day−1 and RMSE between 0.12 and 0.18 mm day−1, respectively. As expected, when both variables were missing, the ETo calculation increased its error, with an RMSE between 0.32 and 0.42 mm day−1. A proper estimation of ETo in the Andean páramo contributes to improved water productivity for domestic and industrial uses, irrigated agriculture, and hydropower.

AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination poses a significant threat to human health, ecosystems, and agriculture, with levels ranging from 12 to 75% attributed to mine waste and stream sediments. This naturally element is abundant in Earth's crust and gets released into the environment through mining and rock processing, causing ≈363 million people to depend on As-contaminated groundwater. To combat this issue, introducing a sustainable hydrochar system has achieved a remarkable removal efficiency of over 92% for arsenic through adsorption. This comprehensive review presents an overview of As contamination in the environment, with a specific focus on its impact on drinking water and wastewater. It delves into the far-reaching effects of As on human health, ecosystems, aquatic systems, and agriculture, while also exploring the effectiveness of existing As treatment systems. Additionally, the study examines the potential of hydrochar as an efficient adsorbent for As removal from water/wastewater, along with other relevant adsorbents and biomass-based preparations of hydrochar. Notably, the fusion of hydrochar with nanoparticle-centric approaches presents a highly promising and environmentally friendly solution for achieving the removal of As from wastewater, exceeding >99% efficiency. This innovative approach holds immense potential for advancing the realms of green chemistry and environmental restoration. Various challenges associated with As contamination and treatment are highlighted, and proposed solutions are discussed. The review emphasizes the urgent need to advance treatment technologies, improve monitoring methods, and enhance regulatory frameworks. Looking outlook, the article underscores the importance of fostering research efforts, raising public awareness, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to address this critical environmental issue. Such efforts are vital for UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially clean water and sanitation (Goal 6) and climate action (Goal 13), crucial for global sustainability.

AB  - Groundwater storage changes in the Amazon River Basin (ARB) play an important role in the hydrological behavior of the region, with significant influence on climate variability and rainforest ecosystems. The GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions provide gravity anomalies from which it is possible to monitor changes in terrestrial water storage, albeit at low spatial resolution. This study downscaled GRACE and GRACE-FO data from machine learning models from 1° (110 km approx) to 0.25° (27.5 km approx). It estimated the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial and groundwater storage anomalies between 2002 and 2021 for the Amazon River Basin. In parallel, the Random Forest and AdaBoost algorithms were compared and analyzed. The results reflected a good fit of the models with a very low error and a slight superiority in the predictions obtained by AdaBoost. On the predictions at 0.25°, spatial patterns associated with the strong influence on storage changes of some rivers and snow-capped mountains were identified, as well as an increase in the accuracy of the scaled data of the original ones. Positive long-term behavior was also obtained in terrestrial and groundwater storage of 14.26 ± 1.18 km3/yr and + 22.24 ± 1.18 km3/yr, respectively. Validation of the time series of groundwater anomalies to water levels in the monitoring wells obtained maximum correlation coefficients of 0.85 with confidence levels of 0.01. These results are promising for satellite information in water management, especially in regional monitoring of unconfined aquifers. The obtained data is stored in a dedicated repository (Satizábal-Alarcón et al., 2023).

AB  - This study presents a new land cover map for the Upper Paraná River Basin (UPRB-2015), with high spatial resolution (30 m), and a high number of calibration and validation sites. To the new map, 50 Landsat-8 scenes were classified with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and their level of agreement was assessed using overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The generated map was compared by area and by pixel with six global products (MODIS, GlobCover, Globeland30, FROM-GLC, CCI-LC and, GLCNMO). The results of the new classification showed an overall accuracy ranging from 67% to 100%, depending on the sub-basin (80.0% for the entire UPRB). Kappa coefficient was observed ranging from 0.50 to 1.00 (average of 0.73 in the whole basin). Anthropic areas cover more than 70% of the entire UPRB in the new product, with Croplands covering 46.0%. The new mapped areas of croplands are consistent with local socio-economic statistics but don’t agree with global products, especially FROM-GLC (14,9%), MODIS (33.8%), GlobCover (71.2%), and CCI (67.8%). In addition, all global products show generalized spatial disagreement, with some sub-basins showing areas of cropland varying by an order of magnitude, compared to UPRB-2015. In the case of Grassland, covering 25.6% of the UPRB, it was observed a strong underestimation by all global products. Even for the Globeland30 and MODIS, which show some significant fraction of pasture areas, there is a high level of disagreement in the spatial distribution. In terms of general agreement, the seven compared mappings (including the new map) agree in only 6.6% of the study area, predominantly areas of forest and agriculture. Finally, the new classification proposed in this study provides better inputs for regional studies, especially for those involving hydrological modeling as well as offers a more refined LU/LC data set for atmospheric numerical models.

AB  - In recent decades, climate change has caused an increase in anomalies in climatic variables and endangered critical infrastructures such as water resources. This change is of paramount importance for southern Iran, especially in the low-precipitation Sistan Plain. Therefore, it is crucial to consider variations in evaporation in the past and the trends of its future changes for water resources planning and management. To manage water resources in the region, this study was conducted to estimate variation in and rate of evaporation from the surface of Chahnimeh reservoirs for future decades using effective climate change models. The SDSM model was applied in 2050–2030 and 2080–2000 periods to simulate evaporation in the coming decades. The values of evaporation under climate change indicate an overall increase of more than 300 mm. According to the results of the WEAP model, much of the Chahnimeh reservoir’s water is consumed by the Zahedan and Zabol urban sectors. A lower share of water is allocated to the agricultural sector of the Sistan Plain compared to these two nodes. The withdrawal rates from these reservoirs will increase with increasing the population growth rate in the coming years. Furthermore, the evaporation rate will also increase. Hence, assuming a constant water flow discharge into the Chahnimeh reservoirs, severe water stress will occur in Sistan Plain and Zahedan water requirement.

AB  - Global climate change has led to large fluctuations in lake levels in recent years as meteorological and hydrological parameters have changed and water use has been intense. Water scientists use various computer models to analyze the hydrological variables recorded in the past and make projections for all future scenarios. Based on the technological progress, six different types of algorithms were studied in this review to predict the water level in lakes. The prediction results show that Deep Learning (DL) has the highest accuracy in terms of the evaluation metrics. Since the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field is still emerging and continue to improve, this study highlights better comprehension of current applications and the problems that need to be investigated more for LWL forecasting techniques. It reveals that the studies mainly focused on lakes either in USA or China and there is room for improvement for other locations that are scarcely investigated.

AB  - Extreme rainfall events within landslide-prone areas can be catastrophic, resulting in loss of property, infrastructure, and life. A global Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model provides routine near-real time estimates of landslide hazard using Integrated Multi-Satellite Precipitation Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Mission (IMERG). However, it does not provide information on potential landslide hazard in the future. Forecasting potential landslide events at a global scale presents an area of open research. This study compares a global precipitation forecast provided by NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) with near-real time satellite precipitation estimates. The Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor gauge corrected (MRMS-GC) reference is used to assess the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The forecast lead time of 24hrs is considered, with a focus on extreme precipitation events. The performance of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast products is assessed in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio, critical success index and hit bias as well as continuous statistics. The results show that seasonality influences the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products. Comparison of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast globally as well as in several event case studies (Colombia, southeast Asia, and Tajikistan) reveals that GEOS-Forecast detects extreme rainfall more frequently relative to IMERG for these specific analyses. For recent landslide points across the globe, the 24hr accumulated precipitation forecast >100 mm corresponds well with near-real time daily accumulated IMERG precipitation estimates. GEOS-Forecast and IMERG precipitation match more closely for tropical cyclones than for other types of storms. The main intention of this study is to assess the viability of using a global forecast for landslide predictions and understand the extent of the variability between these products to inform where we would expect the landslide modeling results to most prominently diverge. Results of this study will be used to inform how forecasted precipitation estimates can be incorporated into the LHASA model to provide the first global predictive view of landslide hazards.

AB  - Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow bands of high-water vapor content in the low troposphere of mid-latitude regions through which most of the poleward moisture is being transported. ARs have been represented statistically as the regions of intense vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) in the atmosphere. These ARs have been found positively correlated with extreme precipitation and flood events at some coastal mid-latitude regions and thus have been linked to several socioeconomic implications. The robust and accurate forecasts of AR availability at a significant lead time can be a useful tool for managing AR-associated floods and water resources. To enhance the knowledge of data-driven methods for modelling nonlinear atmospheric dynamics associated with ARs, we have explored some popular deep-learning architectures for predicting AR availability. AR availability maps derived from the statistical characterization of IVT using ERA5 reanalyses data of ECMWF from the testing dataset are taken as ground truth for the prediction. The predictions of the models have been analyzed based on popularly adopted performance evaluation metrics structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Our proposed autoencoder model outperforms the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and Conv-LSTM model. We have got comparatively higher scores (average) of SSIM (0.739) and PSNR (64.424) as well as lower scores (average) of RMSE (0.155) and MSE (0.025) for the predictions which signify the ability of our model to learn spatiotemporal features linked with AR-dynamics.

Understand whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the risk of different types of conflict worldwide in the context of climate change.
Methodology
Based on the database of armed conflict, COVID-19, detailed climate, and non-climate data covering the period 2020–2021, we applied Structural Equation Modeling specifically to reorganize the links between climate, COVID-19, and conflict risk. Moreover, we used the Boosted Regression Tree method to simulate conflict risk under the influence of multiple factors.
Findings
The transmission risk of COVID-19 seems to decrease as the temperature rises. Additionally, COVID-19 has a substantial worldwide impact on conflict risk, albeit regional and conflict risk variations exist. Moreover, when testing a one-month lagged effect, we find consistency across regions, indicating a positive influence of COVID-19 on demonstrations (protests and riots) and a negative relationship with non-state and violent conflict risk.
Conclusion
COVID-19 has a complex effect on conflict risk worldwide under climate change.
Implications
Laying the theoretical foundation of how COVID-19 affects conflict risk and providing some inspiration for the implementation of relevant policies.

AB  - The assessment of sources of moisture is key to the understanding of the hydrological cycle at different time scales, because it enables the establishment of source-sink relationships and the identification of the main moisture transport conveyors and associated processes, the result of which is precipitation. Gimeno et al. (2012) provided a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in the assessment of moisture source-sinks and how different approaches can contribute to improving our knowledge of this component of the Earth’s Climate System. Since then, a variety of studies have focused on more specific aspects of the moisture budget and the source-sink distribution across the globe by integrating observations, satellite-derived products, physical tracers and numerical modelling. Here, we summarise the main advances in the field related to the impact of the moisture source-sink relationship on rainfall distribution, and add to the scientific debate on the question of the residence time of water vapour. We also revisit some of the recent advances in the role of the major mechanisms of moisture transport at a global scale, mainly Atmospheric Rivers and Low-Level Jet systems (Gimeno et al., 2016), in terms of their effects on precipitation extremes. Finally, we set out some of the main challenges for future research.

AB  - River algal blooms have become a newly emerging global environmental issue in recent decades. Compared with water eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs, algal blooms in large river systems can cause more severe consequences to watershed ecosystems at the watershed scale. However, reveal the causes of river algal blooms remains challenging in the interdisciplinary of hydrological-ecological-environmental research, due to its complex interaction mechanisms impacted by multiple factors. In addition, there were still considerable uncertainties on the characteristics, impacts, driving factors, as well as the applicable water system models for river algal blooms. In this paper, we reviewed existing literature to elaborate the definition and negative effects of river algal blooms. We analyzed sensitive factors including nutrient, hydrological and climatic elements. We also discussed the application of ecohydrological models under complicated hydrological conditions. Finally, we explored the essence of the river algal bloom by the interaction effects of physical and biogeochemical process impacted by of climate change and human activities. The model-data integration accounting for multi-factor effects was expected to provide scientific guidance for the prevent and control of algal blooms in large river systems.

AB  - Global changes in climate and land use are threatening natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem services people rely on. This is why it is necessary to track and monitor spatiotemporal change at a level of detail that can inform science, management, and policy development. The current constellation of multiple Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites collecting imagery at predominantly ≤30-m spatial resolution affords an opportunity for the generation of global medium- resolution products every few days. Our goal is to both identify the information needs and provide direction towards the generation of a suite of global, high-level, systematically-generated, medium-resolution products designed for both management and science. Our vision builds on the success of the NASA MODIS/VIIRS product suite, while recognizing the unique strengths of medium-resolution satellite data given their higher spatial resolution and longer time series. We propose a suite of 13 essential products that enable the characterization of the current state and changes in the biosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere, and would fill information needs identified by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites for the Global Climate Observing System and the Global Terrestrial Observing System, by the National Research Council of the US National Academies in the decadal survey, and by others. These products are: land cover, land cover change, burned area, forest loss, vegetation indices, phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo, land surface temperature, snow cover, ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we provide a list of desirable products poised for addition to the essential products (e.g., crop type, emissivity, and ice sheet velocity). Lastly, we suggest aspirational products requiring further algorithm development (e.g., forest structure and crop yield). For the identified essential products, algorithms are in place, making it feasible to begin generating products systematically. These products should be accompanied by quality and accuracy assessments undertaken following consensus protocols. Five decades after the first Landsat satellite, and two decades after the MODIS products were first produced, it is time now for readily available, standardized, and consistent high-level products built upon medium-resolution imagery, thereby fulfilling the promise and the vision that inspired the Landsat program since its inception.

AB  - Wildfires can significantly impact regional and global climate, human health, and ecosystems, making it necessary to model their behavior and predict their outcomes. With increasing global temperatures and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change, the frequency and intensity of wildfires are expected to increase, heightening the requirement for accurate wildfire simulation models to support wildfire management and mitigation efforts. However, the interactions between the causative variables of wildfires and the wildfire bivariate characteristics have not been explored in wildfire modeling. Therefore, the copula function was applied to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship of the dependence structure in wildfire statistics and the relationship between wildfire causative variables. Subsequently, we modeled wildfire characteristics globally using six machine learning models and compared the performances of the models. Specifically, the main conclusions were obtained as follows: (1) among the six machine learning models, long short-term memory had the best applicability in simulating wildfire characteristics; (2) when there were 4 predictors, the accuracy of wildfire characteristic simulation reached the average level; and (3) long short-term memory achieved excellent model performance within 56% of the global climate sub-regions. Overall, this analysis provides a reference to better understand wildfire and contributes to wildfire management.

AB  - Fasciolosis caused by the trematode Fasciola hepatica is an important parasitosis in both livestock and humans across the globe. Chronic infections in cattle are associated with considerable economic losses. As a prerequisite for an effective control and prevention of fasciolosis in cattle fine-scale predictive models on farm-level are needed. Since disease transmission will only occur where the mollusc intermediate host is present, the objective of our research was to develop a regression model that allows to predict the local presence or absence of Galba truncatula as principal intermediate host for Fasciola hepatica in Switzerland. By implementing generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) a total amount of 70 variables were analysed for their potential influence on the likelihood πi of finding Galba truncatula at a certain site. Important site-specific features could be considered by selecting suitable modelling procedures. The statistical software R was used to conduct regression analysis, performing the grplasso and the glmmLasso method. The selection of parameters was based on 10-fold cross validation and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This yielded a total number of 19 potential predictor variables for the grplasso and 13 variables for the glmmLasso model, which also included random effects. Nine variables appeared to be relevant predictors for the occurrence of Galba truncatula in both models. These included reed/humid area, spring water, water bodies within a 100 m radius, and trees/bushes as powerful positive predictors. High soil depth, temperatures frequently exceeding 30 °C in the year preceding the search for snails and temperatures below 0 °C especially in the second year before were identified to exert an adverse effect on the occurrence of Galba truncatula. Temperatures measured near ground level proved to be more powerful predictors than macroclimatic parameters. Precipitation values seemed to be of minor impact in the given setting. Both regression models may be convenient for a fine-scale prediction of the occurrence of Galba truncatula, and thus provide useful approaches for the development of future spatial transmission models, mapping the risk of fasciolosis in Switzerland on farm-level.

AB  - A thorough validation of global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) models requires reliable ground-observed ET data. While the open-access eddy-covariance flux measurements are widely used for such a purpose, they have certain drawbacks, and thus, other alternative publicly available reference datasets are urgently needed. Using remote sensing and ground-based observational data, this study provides water-balance-based evapotranspiration (ETwb) estimates for 56 large (>105 km2) river basins of the world over the 1983–2016 period. For each basin, the observed runoff and four different precipitation (Prec) data sources were combined with three types of terrestrial water storage change (dS) estimates, yielding altogether 12 annual ETwb time-series. An optimally merged ETwb time-series was eventually produced using the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat method. The relative uncertainty in the ETwb estimates is less than 10 % in most basins and it stems primarily from the uncertainty in Prec. In summary, this new ETwb dataset has the following advantages: i) The gauge undercatch in Prec was corrected, thus mitigating the well-known general underestimation of ETwb in mid- and high-latitudes; ii) Multiple Prec and dS datasets were combined to account for the uncertainty in the water balance approach, thereby enabling the quantification of the uncertainty in ETwb and its sources, and; iii) The ETwb dataset stretches more than three decades, making it appropriate for evaluating long-term trends in global ET models. This ETwb dataset is publicly available (https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/en/data/e010cd0d-0881-4e7e-9d63-d36992750b04) and may serve as a benchmarking tool to calibrate/validate large-scale ET models for an improved understanding of regional- and/or global-scale ET processes.

AB  - The rainfall erosivity index or R-factor is a climate-driven parameter affecting soil erosion. We studied the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity over India for the historical (1951 – 2014) and two future periods (near future: 2015–2040; far future: 2041–2070) under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585). We used 15-minute rainfall datasets from 70-gauge stations to establish a relationship between rainfall erosivity estimated from 15-minute rainfall data and those estimated from 30 and 60-minute rainfall data. Further, we used 30,203 erosive storm rainfall data from 329 stations in India to estimate the daily rainfall erosivity model parameters. After that, annual rainfall erosivity values of 329 stations, nine bio-climatic variables, and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model were used to prepare rainfall erosivity maps for the historical and two future periods. The bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6) dataset of 13 models was used for deriving bioclimatic variables and rainfall erosivity estimation for the historical and future periods. We used the GPR model to find the historical period's mean annual rainfall erosivity value as 5225 MJ.mm.ha−1.h−1.year−1. The result shows a +13 % and +15 % increase in the mean rainfall erosivity over India in the near future under SSP245 and SSP585 projected pathways compared to the historical period. The increase in erosivity values in the far future is even higher at +22 % and +31 % under SSP245, and SSP585 projected pathways, respectively. The northwestern and central India is likely to have a pronounced increase in rainfall erosivity in the far future. The change in rainfall erosivity due to climate change might substantially impact India's land and water resources, which is mainly an agrarian economy. The outcome of the present study could help in better planning and management of land and water resources in the upcoming decades.

AB  - This study presents a Bayesian-driven ensemble learning framework to minimize errors in evapotranspiration (ET) data assimilation, thereby generating a continuous-scale ET estimation with improved accuracy for the data-scarce arid Central Asia (CA). Five state-of-the-art gridded ET products were extensively tested and utilized to reconstruct new long-term ET data at grid scale, including two Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-Land Surface Models (LSM) (Catchment and NOAH), two reanalysis products (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications – ver. 2 (MERRA2)), along with the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam (GLEAM) satellite ET product ver. 3.6b. Taylor Skill Score was employed to evaluate the input gridded ET datasets, using in situ measurements across four arid biomes — cropland, shrubland, farmland, and grassland —as benchmarks. Bayes-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Bayes-MCMC)-derived logarithmically transformed predictors from the posterior ensemble anomalies were standardized to resolve the mismatches in the cumulative distribution functions of ET data relating to the in situ observations. We found that the constrained residual errors were more profound between 45th and 95th percentiles for the rescaled total ET anomalies across all the input ET datasets at 95 % confidence interval. Moreover, the weighted ensemble estimates derived from the Bayes-MCMC were instrumental in correcting ET anomalies, leading to the robust reconstruction of a more reliable ensemble mean ET data for Central Asia (CAETens) at monthly temporal and 0.25° spatial resolutions, spanning from 2003 to 2020. Overall, CAETens exhibited superior performance, achieving the highest averaged Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.75 and registering the lowest Root Mean Square Error of 6.85 mm/m compared to the standalone gridded ET products. Comparisons of spatial distributions of fine-scale features, and evaluations using standard metrics revealed that all ET products varied significantly (p < 0.05) by biome types. Remarkably, only CAETens exhibited a reasonable low positive bias and pronounced ability to resolve the complex spatiotemporal patterns associated with the input gridded ET products. The study bridges the gap in continuous ET monitoring for sustainable water resources management in CA.

AB  - Drought is known as a complex natural phenomenon because of its multifaceted effect on the environment. Composite drought indices have been considered a useful tool to capture the compound drought impacts, however, few of them are capable of operating at multi-timescales. Moreover, the vast of composite drought indices fail to depict the whole water deficit on terrestrial because of the ignoring of groundwater. In this study, we linearly combined two satellite observed variables, TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage) and VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit), to develop a new index WDDI (Water Deficit Drought Index). It can provide the global composite drought conditions at multi-timescales by different weight combinations. The global multiscalar SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively. Weights assessment results showed that SPEI and WDDI reached moderate correlations (r > 0.4) over the globe, especially stronger in the summer season (0.5 < r < 0.88). Good agreements between WDDI and scPDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index), SPEI were found in the global historical drought area statistics, especially in area statistics of severe or worse drought conditions. WDDI at short and long timescales were found to be sensitive to drought signals in the meteorological and hydrological system respectively as it produced moderate or stronger correlations with VsmCI (Volumetric soil moisture Condition Index) and RCI (Runoff Condition Index) in most parts of the world. The application of WDDI in the specific drought events (the 2010 Russian drought and the 2012–2016 California drought) further reinforced the above inferences and revealed the unique superiority of considering groundwater deficit in hydrological drought monitoring. The new proposed multiscalar WDDI could help practitioners better identify the drought conditions and understand the drought propagation mechanism from the meteorological to the hydrological system.

AB  - Statistical models were developed for downscaling reanalysis data to monthly precipitation at 48 observation stations scattered across the Australian State of Victoria belonging to wet, intermediate and dry climate regimes. Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950–1991 and validated over the period 1992–2014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as flood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation. Furthermore, it was found that irrespective of the climate regime, the SVM and RVM-based precipitation downscaling models showed the best performance with the Polynomial kernel.

AB  - In light of the rapidly increasing regulation of rivers due to planned and constructed reservoirs, monitoring reservoir operations has become very crucial. The Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) framework was developed to monitor reservoir operations globally, using hydrological modeling and satellite observations. With feedback from stakeholders, improvements in the RAT framework are demonstrated in this study using the Mekong River Basin as an example. A novel multi-sensor reservoir area mapping technique was developed using complementary strengths of optical and SAR sensors at a 1–5 day temporal resolution, allowing the quantification of sub-weekly reservoir operations. Additionally, the skill of radar altimeters in the RAT framework was tested using the Jason-3 altimeter. Using in-situ data from three Thai reservoirs in the Mekong Basin, consistent improvements were observed as compared to the original RAT framework. A functionality for visualizing forecasted outflow was also added using historically inferred reservoir operations or stakeholder-driven target storage expectations.

AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), two successive satellite-based missions starting in 2002, have provided an unprecedented way of measuring global terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA). However, a temporal gap exists between GRACE and GRACE-FO products from July 2017 to May 2018, which introduces bias and uncertainties in TWSA calculations and modeling. Previous studies have incorporated hydroclimatic factors as predictors for filling the gap, but most of them utilized artificial intelligence or pure statistical models that generally de-trended TWSA and had no physical foundation. Thus, a physically-based reconstruction is required for increasing robustness. In this study, we bridge the temporal gap by developing an empirical hydrological model. The “abcd” model, a T-based snow component, and linear correction are utilized to represent runoff generation, snow dynamics, and long-term trends. The testing results indicate that our hydrological model can successfully reconstruct TWSA in tropical, temperature, and continental climates, although further improvement is needed for arid climates. Our reconstruction for the gap achieves high accuracy and robustness as shown by the evaluations against sea-level budget and GLDAS-derived TWSA. Compared to previous studies using artificial intelligence or statistical techniques, our hydrological model performs similarly in the gap filling but does not involve de-trended or de-seasonalized transformations, which will facilitate the combination of GRACE and GRACE-FO products and improve the physical understanding of global TWSA.

AB  - There is a growing concern on a global scale that the world should transition towards the utilisation of energy-efficient technologies. Hydropower plays a very significant part in the fight against climate change, and as a result, it lessens the impact that climate changewill have on our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both the effectiveness of hydropower generation and the amount of streamflow are impacted by climate change as well as land use and land cover (LULC). Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to conduct a literature review on the topic of the past and future effects of climate, land use, and land cover changes on hydropower generation. This review will be based on the entries found in a number of reliable databases. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse how LULC and climate change will affect hydropower generation and development. The research was based on 158 pieces of relevant literature that had been reviewed by experts and indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The review was carried out to determine three goals in mind: the impact of climate change on hydropower generation and development; the impact of climate change on streamflow; and the combined impact of changes in climate and changes in LULC on hydropower. The findings bring to light the primary factors contributing to climate change as well as shifts in LULC which are essential to the generation of hydropower on all scales. The study identifies factors such as precipitation, temperature, floods, and droughts as examples of climate change. Deforestation, afforestation, and urbanisation are identified as the primary causes of changes in LULC over the past several decades. These changes have a negative impact on the generation and development of hydropower.

AB  - An operational global hydrological model (DHI-GHM) has been developed that provides historical, real-time, 10-day and seasonal forecast simulations at the global scale. DHI-GHM is comprised of a distributed gridded rainfall-runoff model with a spatial resolution of 0.1° and an agile kinematic routing model that moves water between model grid cells and sub-catchments and in the river system. Model output includes gridded hydrological variables, such as soil moisture content and different runoff components, and discharge at more than 1 million river points globally. DHI-GHM uses a novel parameterization scheme, where global data products of land surface physical characteristics are used to establish relations with model parameters, and thus DHI-GHM does not rely on local discharge data for model calibration. Multiple forcing datasets were tested, and the combination of ERA5 precipitation and Priestley-Taylor potential evaporation yielded the overall best results with a median KGE of 0.51 and average water balance error of 0.78% based on data from 1667 discharge stations worldwide. The model results and the operational system are particularly relevant for organizations with national, regional, or global scope who need information on large areas at once and for data scarce areas or projects without resources for local scale models.

AB  - This study presents an in-depth analysis of the economic policies and implications surrounding artisanal gold mining, reframing the discussion from geographical specifics to a broader policy and economic context. Utilizing advanced geospatial data from the Landsat image collection through “Google Earth Engine,” the research evaluates the economic impact and policy challenges posed by artisanal gold mining over a period from 2011 to 2021. The approach combines change detection methodologies with machine learning to quantify the economic repercussions of land cover changes due to mining. The analysis reveals significant economic transformations, with an average of 2700 ha of land affected annually, culminating in around 48,000 ha over the decade, highlighting a critical period from 2013 to 2020. Importantly, the study identifies policy gaps, especially in the management of protected areas where approximately 800 ha of mining occurred. The findings underscore the urgent need for policy interventions to mitigate the adverse economic and environmental impacts of unregulated mining. The study contributes to a broader understanding of the economic ramifications of artisanal mining and serves as a call to action for policymakers to address the challenges of sustainable mining practices and economic development.

AB  - Understanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tora and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C. tora (annual) and L. camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C. tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L. camara to the solar radiation. C. tora may invade central India, while L. camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L. camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C. tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.

AB  - Recently, unprecedented extreme drought has appeared around the world. As the most direct signal of drought, evapotranspiration deserves a more systematic and comprehensive study. Further depicting their divergence of potential (ETp) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) will help to explore the limitation of evapotranspiration. In this paper, the multi-source remote sensing datasets from the Climate Research Unit (CRU), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on experiment (GRACE-FO), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002 to 2020 were employed to explore the influence of meteorological, hydrological and botanical factors on ETp, ETa and their divergence – reduction of evapotranspiration (Er) which represents regional vegetation and water limitations. According to the Pearson correlation analysis and the Boruta Algorithm based on Random Forest, the temperature is the first decisive promoter of evapotranspiration in the most area while the sparse vegetation is the primary or second determinant limiting the evapotranspiration in 61.84% of the world. In addition, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data from 2030 to 2090 and the support vector machine regression (SVMR) model were applied to predict the future global ETp, ETa and Er on the pixel scale. Predicted results of the model considering the water change not only can highly improve the model performance (with higher R2), but also can simulate the drought in Europe and the more intense ETa in Africa. Thus, Er proposed in this study provide a good reference for regional ETa except for ETp. The future evapotranspiration value derived by introducing the water storage changes into the machine learning model in this study is also valuable for climate change adaptation and drought warning.

AB  - Effective management of water resources requires reliable estimates of land surface states and fluxes, including water balance components. But most land surface models run in uncoupled mode and do not produce river discharge at catchment scales to be useful for water resources management applications. Such integrated systems are also rare over India where hydrometeorological extremes have wreaked havoc on the economy and people. So, an Indian Land Data Assimilation System (ILDAS) with a coupled land surface and a hydrodynamic model has been developed and driven by multiple meteorological forcings (0.1°, daily) to estimate land surface states, channel discharge, and floodplain inundation. ILDAS benefits from an integrated framework as well as the largest suite of observation records collected over India and has been used to produce a reanalysis product for 1981–2021 using four forcing datasets, namely, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), ECMWF’s ERA-5, and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded precipitation. We assessed the uncertainty and bias in these precipitation datasets and validated all major components of the terrestrial water balance, i.e., surface runoff, soil moisture, terrestrial water storage anomalies, evapotranspiration, and streamflow, against a combination of satellite and in situ observation datasets. Our assessment shows that ILDAS can represent the hydrological processes reasonably well over the Indian landmass with IMD precipitation showing the best relative performance. Evaluation against ESA-CCI soil moisture shows that MERRA-2 based estimates outperform the others, whereas ERA-5 performs best in simulating evapotranspiration when evaluated against MODIS ET. Evaluations against observed records show that CHIRPS-based estimates have the highest performance in reconstructing surface runoff and streamflow. Once operational, this system will be useful for supporting transboundary water management decision making in the region.

AB  - The analysis and prediction of the Earthquake for smart cities are of greatest significance because all the critical infrastructure like drinking water resources, mobile networks, healthcare, power grid, and transportation, may affect the social-economic balance of the place which is tampered with such natural disasters. An earthquake has some effect on the environment due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates known as Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEE). These changes can be divided into 2 categories namely primary (e.g. subsidence, surface faulting) and secondary effects (displaced rocks, tsunami, landslides). In this paper, the major contribution revolves around earthquakes and their analysis. Earthquakes occur due to the shifting of tectonic plates on the lithosphere. These movements occur due to the Frictional stress between gliding plate borders builds up and leads to fault line failure. This sudden shaking of the plates releases a certain kind of energy in the Lithosphere which creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are also categorized into different classes ranging from minor to great, depending on their magnitude.

AB  - Drought is one of the major hazards that could have a significant impact on agriculture. In this study, two drought indices at high spatial resolution: Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) were derived by 1 km downscaled Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) long-term SM and soil attribute products, and used to analyze the drought conditions in Australia in 2015–2019. The SWDI was calculated from SMAP SM estimates and SM at field capacity/wilting point derived from soil attribute data, while the SMDI was calculated by integrating GLDAS and SMAP SM using a temporally incremental based method. We found that in the eastern and western coastal regions, the droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and winter. The temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern/western coasts. On the other hand, the inland regions always had more severe drought conditions. Additionally, the validation results for the 1 km SMAP SM using International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in situ data showed reliable accuracy and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) ranged from 0.02 to 0.09 m3/m3. Both SWDI and SMDI showed clear seasonal and interannual variability, and the drought conditions worsened in 2017–2019. From the 1 km SWDI/SMDI maps in the Murray-Darling River Basin, terrain and streamflow were found to be two deterministic factors for the drought conditions.

AB  - Stable isotopes in water (oxygen-18 and deuterium) are hydrologic tracers, which have been embedded into both analytical mass balance and physically based continuous simulation models, improving hydrologic process partitioning and regional source identification, resulting in early climate change detection. Recent advances in the field of isotope hydrology have improved coordinated investment in global monitoring networks, invested in integrated modelling tools to support prediction and model evaluation, and expanded the scale of analyses possible. This review focuses on the applications of isotope tracers to large scale hydrologic modelling, its inception and evolution, and future directions for advancing this field with emphasis on the utility of isotope tracers for operational water resources prediction. The hydrologic community has begun to steer toward alternative hydrologic data due to the coinciding realities of limited data records and urgent data needs. Water resources infrastructure and management requires projections of water supply beyond the 50- to 100-year design life, with the general rule of flow frequency necessitating a 100- to 200-year assessment, however, there exist few data networks globally with records sufficient to support this kind of long-term assessment, and climate change is increasing the frequency of these extreme events. Historically, large-scale, and long time series simulation has meant less attention on process function (model fidelity) due to computational constraints, however, we argue that this may no longer be adequate under increasingly complex climate-hydrologic feedbacks, and integrated system models that incorporate human decisions, environmental health and socio-economic pressures. To expand the uptake of isotope tracers in practice, we emphasize their value for extreme quantile prediction under future projections and call for the community of practice to support data networks and accessibility, support peer review of large-domain (less data intensive) applications, and employ the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) scientific principles. Though still an emerging scientific field, isotope hydrology has considerable value to the practitioner community with the proper education and training necessary to build confidence, underpinned by well developed and accessible tools for deployment.

AB  - Estimating global land surface evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance for assessing the impact of climate change on the global hydrological cycle and energy balance. In this study, we propose a surface energy balance constrained deep learning (DL-SEB) model for simulating global land surface evapotranspiration (ET). The accuracy of the DL-SEB model in estimating ET was tested using FLUXNET observations. The results suggested that the proposed DL-SEB model significantly enhanced the simulation capability of extreme ET events compared with the original deep learning model (without being coupled with the energy balance equation). The DL-SEB model was further applied to reconstruct global ET changes during 2000–2019 based on meteorological, soil, vegetation, and flux data sets. The annual average global land surface ET was 613 mm/yr during the period 2000–2019 (exclude Antarctica and deserts). The global land surface ET exhibited a significant upward trend with average increase rate of 1.16 mm/yr during the past two decades, which corresponds to approximately 3.8% increase above the mean global ET during 2000–2019. The positive trend of global land surface ET was driven by the combined effect of air temperature (Ta), soil moisture (SM), net radiation flux (Rn) and leaf area index (LAI). The natural climatic events such as El Niño events significantly altered short-term global ET variation, but did not changed the long-term increase trend of global ET. This study enhanced the understanding of the impact of climate change on the global land surface ET. The proposed DL-SEB model achieved a physics-based, smart and reliable ET simulation at global and regional scales.

AB  - The energy, water and food (EWF) nexus modelling and analysis frameworks proposed recently have demonstrated their effectiveness in the assessment and quantification of synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between the three sectors. They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates “algorithmic resilience thinking” to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions.

AB  - Wetland plants are a key factor in ecosystems but are threatened by water extraction and water resource exploitation. Ecological water supplementation is a common solution to the water scarcity problem in wetlands. In this study, the Zhalong Wetland with a complex water regime was divided into several subareas with relatively strong hydrologic connectivity based on a hydrodynamic model and cluster analysis. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamics were simulated and verified with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network models established for the various wetland subareas based on the subarea water levels and temperature and sunshine duration data. To evaluate the effects of different ecological water supplementation scenarios on the spatiotemporal NDVI variation across the wetland, the water levels of subareas under different scenarios were used to drive the LSTM model. The results indicate that (1) the spatiotemporal variation in the NDVI at most nodes within the wetland was accurately simulated, but large errors generally occurred in regions with small lakes. (2) Ecological water supplementation with continuous and low-flow discharge imposed highly positive influences on the annual maximum NDVI in the wetland against the background of limited water resources. (3) The lower reach in the largest subarea was less positively affected by wetland ecological water supplementation. (4) Water supplementation with discharge in April and September was recommended because of the benefits for the nidification and breeding of water fowl species and the limited conflict between agricultural and ecological water. This study provides important references for both wetland and water resource managers.

AB  - Developing robust systems for monitoring and evaluating water quality is crucial for assessing ecosystem integrity and the impacts of human activities on nature. It also enables the assessment of water management effectiveness, governance systems, and the design and evaluation of public policies. However, designing such monitoring programs is complex due to multiple constraints like eco-hydrological knowledge, economic resources, human capital availability, and governance dynamics. This study combines quantitative and qualitative analyses (virtual watershed methodologies, empirical modeling, and theoretical frameworks of water governance) to evaluate the robustness of water quality monitoring systems and identify strengthening alternatives (including institutional design and public policy). The inter and transdisciplinary strategy is tested in the evaluation of eutrophication processes in Uruguay. Major spatial patterns of water quality at a national scale were identified, highlighting the influence of land use, soil types, point sources of pollution, and livestock on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Current monitoring efforts and spatial coverage fall short of adequately addressing water management needs, especially in Uruguay's socio-economic context. Based on the weaknesses identified, an increase in the number of stations (and their spatial distribution) is proposed to have a better representation of biogeophysical and socio-economic conditions diversity. The challenge involves an important transformation (i.e. establishing a network system of public institutional nodes at national and regional levels) due to the country's centralism, fragmented water governance system, and scarce economic assets.

AB  - Terrestrial Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important process for understanding regional or global water, energy, and carbon cycles, and with the development of satellite observations and increased research investment, grid ET products covering a broad spatial extent are becoming more readily available. However, as global warming becomes a reality and extreme climate events occur worldwide, existing studies do not go far enough to verify that these grid products can still be used under extreme climate conditions. This study evaluates nine global ET products, including land surface reanalysis products (GLDAS_CLSM, GLDAS_NOAH, ERA5, and FLDAS), remote sensing (RS) products (GLEAM_v3.6b, MOD16A2, and PMLv2), and multi-source data fusion products (REA and Synthesized), using observations from 153 flux towers worldwide. The objective is to evaluate their performance in estimating ET under extreme climatic conditions (high temperature, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and drought). The results indicate that the estimation accuracy of all ET products is significantly reduced under extreme climatic conditions, showing high uncertainty, and this impact is most severe in the Americas (AM) region. Overall, multi-source data fusion products showed the best estimation performance and were less affected by extreme climatic conditions. Among the remote sensing modeling products, GLEAM_v3.6b showed the best performance, while MOD16A2 has the lowest estimation accuracy. Land surface reanalysis products were most affected by extreme conditions, with CLSM and NOAH showing similar performance and ERA5 having the largest errors (RMSE_ERA5 = 1.699 mm/d, MAE_ERA5 = 1.294 mm/d). The ET products show significant error fluctuations and overestimation (PBias > 0.5) in most of North America, and there is a decline in simulation accuracy in arid and semi-arid regions near 30°N, with most ET products showing overestimation. The most significant errors were observed in cropland areas (CRO) and deciduous broadleaf forest areas (DBF), with significant overestimation in mixed forest areas (MF). The results of this study provide valuable insights for researchers in selecting ET products under extreme climatic conditions and encourage product developers to consider uncertainty under such conditions, thereby improving product accuracy.

AB  - Digitalization is a key enabler of sustainable development of cities’ socio-economic dynamics with the potential to foster climate-friendly urban environments and societies. The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives.

AB  - As a non-linear phenomenon that varies along with agro-climatic conditions alongside many other factors, Evapotranspiration (ET) process represents a complexity when be assessed especially if there is a data scarcity in the weather data. However, even under such a data scarcity, the accurate estimates of ET values remain necessary for precise irrigation. So, the present study aims to: i) evaluate the performance of six hybrid machine learning (ML) models in estimating the monthly actual ET values under different agro-climatic conditions in China for seven provinces (Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan), and ii) select the best-developed model based on statistical metrics and reduce errors between predicted and actual ET (AET) values. AET datasets were divided into 78% for model training (from 1958 to 2007) and the remaining was used for testing (from 2008 to 2021). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) was used as a standalone model at first then the stacking method was applied to integrate DNN with data-driven models such as Additive regression (AR), Random Forest (RF), Random Subspace (RSS), M5 Burned Tree (M5P) and Reduced Error Purning Tree (REPTree). Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF) was used for selection of the best lags inputs to the developed models. Results have revealed that DNN-based hybrid models held better performance than non-hybrid DNN models, such that the DNN-RF algorithm outperformed others during both training and testing stages, followed by DNN-RSS. This model has acquired the best values of every statistical measure [MAE (10.8, 12.9), RMSE (15.6, 17.4), RAE (31.9%, 41.4%), and RRSE (39.3%, 47.2%)] for training and testing, respectively. In contrast, the DNN model held the worst performance [MAE (14.9, 13.7), RMSE (20.1, 18.2), RAE (43.9%, 43.7%), and RRSE (50.6%, 49.3%)], for training and testing, respectively. Results from the study presented have revealed the capability of DNN-based hybrid models for long-term predictions of the AET values. Moreover, the DNN-RF model has been suggested as the most suitable model to improve future investigation for AET predictions, which could benefit the enhancement of the irrigation process and increase crop yield.

AB  - As the basic industry of national economic development, the electric power industry is closely associated with the overall economic development and social progress. Hydropower, as a power generation form, has fewer data samples than thermal power generation, which leads to a difficult problem to establish an accurate production and energy prediction model. Therefore, a novel production capacity prediction model using extreme learning machine based on Monte Carlo algorithm is presented for energy optimization and saving. Through using the Monte Carlo algorithm, the small sample data can be expanded. Then, the expansion of the small sample data is utilized as the training set and the testing set for the extreme learning machine to predict the production capacity and optimize the energy configuration. Finally, the proposed method is used to predict the production of a hydropower plant for improving the energy efficiency. Compared with the traditional extreme learning machine, the correctness and the applicability of the proposed method are proved. Moreover, the energy optimal configuration of the hydropower industry production can improve the energy efficiency and save the energy of hydropower industrial processes.

AB  - Soil erosion is a direct product of the complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors. Such factors vary over space and time, making the assessment of soil erosion even more difficult. Empirical erosion models such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) provides a rather simple and yet comprehensive framework for assessing soil erosion and its causative factors. RUSLE considers rainfall (R), topography (LS), soil erodibility (K), cover management (C), and support practice (P) as important factors affecting soil erosion. In the past few years, RUSLE has benefited tremendously from advances in geospatial technologies like Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing. In this paper, an overview of recent developments on the use of these geospatial technologies in deriving individual RUSLE factors is provided, placing an emphasis on related successes and challenges. This review is expected to improve the understanding of the role played by such technologies in deriving RUSLE parameters despite existing challenges. Future research, however, must pay special attention to error assessment of remote sensing-derived RUSLE parameters.

Future climate impacts on streamflow are of critical concern due to its importance for water and energy supplies. However, rigorous studies of such impacts involve complicated modeling chains that can be time-consuming and costly to implement. We examine an alternative approach by developing a method to predict the 21st century peak March-May (MAM) streamflow response to warming from historical data alone, specifically, past observations of the Snow-to-Precipitation ratio divided by basin Area (SPA).
Study region
Using the Colorado River Basin (CRB) as a proving ground, we test this empirical relationship over 23 basins ranging in size from 9728 to 639,806 km2 within the CRB. Data was derived from hydrology model simulations forced by a suite of climate models, run under two emissions scenarios.
New hydrological insights
Our proof-of-concept study revealed useful predictive capability (r2 = 0.58) and additionally identified three response types: rain- (basin SPA < 1.2 × 10−3 km-2), snow-rain- (1.4 × 10−3 to 3 × 10−3 km-2), and snow-dominant (>3 × 10−3 km-2). The most dramatic changes occurred in snow-dominant basins where streamflow increased up to 320 % in MAM, but decreased by up to 60 % in the critical high demand months of July-September (JAS). By quantifying the relationship between historical data and future streamflow projections, our findings suggest this empirical relationship is useful to quickly and cheaply determine where and when large changes in hydrology will occur from future warming.

AB  - Surface all-wave net radiation (Rn) plays an important role in various land surface processes, such as agricultural, ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes. Recently, remote sensing of Rn at regional and global scales has attracted considerable attention and has achieved significant advances. However, there are many issues in estimating all-sky daily average Rn at high latitudes, such as posing greater uncertainty by surface and atmosphere satellite products at high latitudes, and unavailability of real-time and accurate cloud base height and temperature parameters. In this study, we developed the LRD (length ratio of daytime) classification model using the genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) to estimate all-sky daily average Rn at high latitudes. With a very high temporal repeating frequency (~6 to 20 times per day) at high latitudes, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to test the proposed method. Rn measurements at 82 sites and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data of MODIS from 2000 to 2017 were matched for model training and validation. Two models for estimating daily average Rn were developed: model I based on instantaneous daytime MODIS observation and model II based on instantaneous nighttime MODIS observation. Validation results of model I showed an R2 of 0.85, an RMSE of 23.66 W/m2, and a bias of 0.27 W/m2, whereas these values were 0.51, 15.04 W/m2, and −0.08 W/m2 for model II, respectively. Overall, the proposed machine learning algorithm with the LRD classification can accurately estimate the all-sky daily average Rn at high latitudes. Mapping of Rn over the high latitudes at 1 km spatial resolution showed a similar spatial distribution to Rn estimates from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. This method has the potential for operational monitoring of spatio-temporal change of Rn at high latitudes with a long-term coverage of MODIS observations.

AB  - This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Radial Basis Function Neural Network (GRNN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Multilayer Perceptron Optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (MLP-PSO) models in analyzing the relationship between rainfall and runoff and in predicting runoff discharge. These models utilize autoregressive input vectors based on daily-observed TRMM rainfall and TMR inflow data. The performance evaluation of each model is conducted using statistical measures to compare their effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between input and output variables. The results consistently demonstrate that the MLP-PSO model outperforms the GRNN and GPR models, achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) across multiple input combinations. Furthermore, the study explores the application of the Empirical Mode Decomposition-Hilbert-Huang Transform (EMD-HHT) in conjunction with the GPR and MLP-PSO models. This combination yields promising results in streamflow prediction, with the MLP-PSO-EMD model exhibiting superior accuracy compared to the GPR-EMD model. The incorporation of different components into the MLP-PSO-EMD model significantly improves its accuracy. Among the presented scenarios, Model M4, which incorporates the simplest components, emerges as the most favorable choice due to its lowest RMSE values. Comparisons with other models reported in the literature further underscore the effectiveness of the MLP-PSO-EMD model in streamflow prediction. This study offers valuable insights into the selection and performance of different models for rainfall-runoff analysis and prediction.

AB  - Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technologies offer effective solutions to reduce the negative effects of crop pests while considering human and environmental health. However, disseminating these technologies faces several barriers, with one of the most significant being the lack of farmer awareness regarding their availability, deployment, and uptake. Digital tools are perceived as a new form of leverage for overcoming these barriers. This study analyzes current IPM digital tools and their potential to boost farmers’ awareness of the deployment and adoption of IPM technologies. From a software engineering perspective, this study aims to emphasize the critical functionalities and limitations of various IPM dissemination tools. It provides valuable insights to improve the adoption process and streamline the dissemination of IPM technologies. Through a systematic search in Google, Scopus and Web of Science for journal articles, over 32 dissemination tools were identified. The study thoroughly assesses these tools and identifies 5 main limitations hindering their regular use, especially in developing countries. Among the most significant limitations are the inadequate representation of tools developed in developing countries, lack of agroecological customization, and insufficient offline functionalities. Building on these findings, a user-centered design is employed to propose a software architecture for a novel Decision Support System (DSS) tailored to farmers and experts. The architecture comprises a local database for offline access, a mapping engine for data visualization, a conversation module with a triangulation engine for knowledge sharing, and an agroecology engine for technology recommendation based on an agroecological classification of the user’s landscape. Drawing from the review, identified limitations, and the proposed architecture, we illustrate how the resulting novel DSS is anticipated to improve the dissemination of IPM technologies.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Environmental pollution is escalating due to rapid global development that often prioritizes human needs over planetary health. Despite global efforts to mitigate legacy pollutants, the continuous introduction of new substances remains a major threat to both human and ecosystem health. In response, global initiatives are focusing on risk assessment and regulation of emerging contaminants, as demonstrated by the establishment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste, and Pollution Prevention. This review identifies the sources and impacts of emerging contaminants on planetary health, emphasizing the importance of adopting a One Health approach. Strategies for monitoring and addressing these pollutants are discussed, underscoring the need for robust and socially equitable environmental policies at both regional and international levels. Urgent actions are needed to transition towards sustainable pollution management practices to safeguard our planet for future generations.

AB  - Global warming, extreme climate events, earthquakes and their accompanying socioeconomic disasters pose significant risks to humanity. Yet due to the nonlinear feedbacks, multiple interactions and complex structures of the Earth system, the understanding and, in particular, the prediction of such disruptive events represent formidable challenges to both scientific and policy communities. During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks-based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and geological relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, and entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems. Notably, these integrating tools and approaches provide new insights and perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the Earth systems. The overall aim of this review is to offer readers the knowledge on how statistical physics concepts and theories can be useful in the field of Earth system science.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a critical parameter influencing hydrological cycles, evaporation, and plant transpiration, connecting land surface and atmospheric interactions. However, traditional SM inversion methods mainly offer daily resolution data, potentially overlooking diurnal fluctuations due to factors such as precipitation and human activities. This study addresses this limitation by shifting to sub-daily (four times per day) SM data, utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) with microwave brightness temperature data obtained from Fengyun-3C and Fengyun-3D (FY-3C and FY-3D) satellites, alongside the microwave vegetation index (MVI) to correct for vegetation effects. The ANN was trained from July 2018 to December 2019 (FY-3C) and January 2019 to December 2022 (FY-3D) using the International Soil Moisture Network as the training target. The ANN method demonstrates favorable global performance, as indicated by r = 0.751–0.805, NSE = 0.56–0.64, RMSE = 0.069–0.077 m3/m3, ubRMSE = 0.066–0.071 m3/m3, and mean Bias = 0.002–0.007 m3/m3 under the cross-validation mode. It can capture significant diurnal variations in SM, especially in regions like central Asia, western Australia, and South America. This research presents the feasibility of producing sub-daily high-temporal-resolution SM products with potential applications in large-scale agricultural drought and flood disaster monitoring, thereby enhancing national disaster management and mitigation strategies.

AB  - DSM has been used to meet the demand for soil information over large areas in more detailed resolution consuming less time. Soil-forming factors proxies (environmental covariates) are crucial to increase accuracy and provide new insights about the soil-landscape. DSM of the southern region of Minas Gerais state (52,982 km2) was generated. Soil profiles that comprise the legacy of decades of pedological surveys were gathered and associated with new (paleoclimatic, organic carbon, and airborne gamma-ray spectrometry) or less explored (digital terrain and climatic variables) environmental covariates under tropical conditions. An iterative routine of soil modeling, accuracy, uncertainty (entropy and MESS) assessment, and discussions concerning soil legacy was performed to equate pattern recognition with knowledge discovery from the random forest algorithm. The soil map was generated with 89% accuracy. The probability maps of the occurrence of the soil classes allowed soil-landscape insights. Less than 0.5% of the areas showed negative MESS, indicating an adequate representation of the soil samples concerning the environmental covariates. The most important environmental covariates were geophysical airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (K and eTh), distance from drainage channels, and paleoclimate (precipitation estimated from 22,000 years ago) consistent with the polygenetic soils.

AB  - Since human beings transitioned to an agrarian lifestyle, technological advancements have enabled evolutions in agriculture, resulting in greater varieties and yields of crops. However, as society faces the effects of climate change and the resulting social challenges, agriculture is at a unique point in its history. Recent advancements in a number of key technologies have placed agriculture at the precipice of another evolution that could not only affect the variety and yield of crops, but also climatological and social outcomes as well. Specifically, advancements with the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and robotics among others have enabled data-driven and automated agriculture. This paper intends to provide a review of current and emerging agriculture technology applications as well as research efforts by examining the advancement of these key technologies in the context of smart farming. We also present future directions for these agriculture technology applications.

AB  - Heatwaves pose increasing threats on water resources for ecosystems and human consumption especially in arid region, such as Central Asia (CA). As the hinterland of Eurasia, water scarcity and land degradation in CA have increased its vulnerability to heatwaves. While the frequency of heatwaves has been examined, more heatwave metrics such as timing are less known, possible influences of soil moisture on heatwave changes in this region are not fully understood. Using reanalysis and observational datasets, here we examine the spatial–temporal changes of heatwaves in CA during 1981–2020 and the role of various associated factors including soil moisture. The results show that the extreme heatwaves occurred more frequently in northwestern Kazakhstan. Temporally, heatwaves have been intensifying with significant increases in frequency (0.10 events/year), intensity (0.81 °C/year), and duration (0.08 days/year) since the 1980 s, and these trends have accelerated since 1997. The first yearly heatwave event tended to occur earlier in more recent decades, indicating an advanced heatwave season. We also found that the heatwave occurrences were significantly correlated with hydro-meteorological factors. In northwestern of CA, extreme heatwaves are exacerbated by a rapid decrease in soil moisture resulting from reduced precipitation and increased solar net radiation in this area. Our findings provide a scientific basis for understanding the mechanisms and predictions of heatwave in arid regions from the climate change perspective.

AB  - Nowadays, transmission system operators require higher degree of observability in real-time to gain situational awareness and improve the decision-making process to guarantee a safe and reliable operation. Digitalization of energy systems allows utilities to monitor the system dynamic performance in real-time at fast time scales. The use of such technologies has unlocked new opportunities to introduce new data driven algorithms for improving the stability assessment and control of the system. Motivated by these challenges, a group of experts have worked together to highlight and establish a baseline set of these common concerns, which can be used as motivation to propose innovative analytics and data-driven solutions. In this document, the results of a survey on 10 transmission system operators around the world are presented and it aims to understand the current practices of the participating companies, in terms of data acquisition, handling, storage, modelling and analytics. The overall objective of this document is to capture the actual needs from the interviewed utilities, thereby laying the groundwork for setting valid assumptions for the development of advanced algorithms in this field.

AB  - Remote sensing based on Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) has proved valuable for monitoring agronomic parameters in precision agriculture. This research aimed to develop predictive models based on machine learning to estimate indirect nitrogen levels (Narea) and grain yield in irrigated rice. During the five phenological stages of cultivation, a Sequoia® camera aboard the Phantom 4® Pro platform acquired the multispectral images. In addition to the spectral bands, 11 vegetation indices were taken as predictors of the response variables (Narea and grain yield). Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) analyzed the ideal monitoring window and selected the model variables. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm adjusted the predictive models that had their performance evaluated in training and testing. The results obtained by the Spearman correlation indicate that the ideal window for monitoring rice by RPAS, for both response variables, occurs at the beginning of the reproduction phase (R1). MLP generated a more accurate model for Narea, demonstrated by Pearson's correlation between predicted and observed values (0.82 and 0.71) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.47 and 10.89. Grain yield models show good MLP at all stages and excellent accuracy. In this way, our results reinforce the excellent efficiency of the combination of remote sensing via RPAS and machine learning in applications aimed at precision agriculture, serving as a useful tool for managing production and evaluating grain yield in irrigated rice fields.

AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery are essential data for land cover discrimination and mapping of vegetation dynamics, offering insights into the number, extent, and condition of agricultural fields. However, an accurate account of the number, location, and variability of fields can be challenging to obtain in a timely manner, particularly at scale or in regions where ground-supporting data are not available, limiting the capacity for food production and water use assessment and planning. To bridge this capacity gap, a convolutional neural network approach was adopted and combined with two clustering techniques: the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and spectral clustering, to provide an account of agricultural fields and their extent across a region lacking ground based information. A random forest classification was also employed to discriminate crop types. Using an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 2018 Landsat-8 data, the approach was applied to classify the shape and delineate the extent of agricultural fields across an agricultural region in Saudi Arabia that had an area under irrigation exceeding 2,300 km2. When assessed against manually identified center-pivot fields (CPFs), the method achieved 97.4% producer’s and 98.0% user’s accuracies on an object basis, and 81.4% producer’s and 85.4% user’s accuracies on a pixel basis for identifying non-CPFs (i.e., tree crop plantations and other non-woody crops). The over- and under-segmentation error for CPFs was 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, with intersection over union errors reported as being 3.5%. The framework showed stability when retrospectively applied to Landsat data from the year 2000, returning 97.5% producer’s and 96.6% user’s accuracies for CPF identification. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics of agricultural development over the past three decades, an analysis of field behavior between 1988 and 2020 was subsequently undertaken. The analysis indicated that the number of CPFs in the study region increased from 45 (covering 20 km2) in 1988 to 5,080 CPFs by 2016 (covering 2,368 km2), followed by a recent reduction to 3,700 CPFs in 2020 (covering 1,581 km2). Through the multi-temporal analysis, individual fields were able to be characterized in terms of their expansion, contraction and activity throughout the study period. Overall, the proposed method was simple to train, efficient in dealing with large datasets, relied on limited in-situ records to a very small degree, and has the potential to be applied to larger national scales, providing an ongoing assessment of important agroinformatic metrics.

AB  - Statistical analyses and descriptive characterizations are sometimes assumed to be offering information on time series forecastability. Despite the scientific interest suggested by such assumptions, the relationships between descriptive time series features (e.g., temporal dependence, entropy, seasonality, trend and linearity features) and actual time series forecastability (quantified by issuing and assessing forecasts for the past) are scarcely studied and quantified in the literature. In this work, we aim to fill in this gap by investigating such relationships, and the way that they can be exploited for understanding hydroclimatic forecastability and its patterns. To this end, we follow a systematic framework bringing together a variety of –mostly new for hydrology– concepts and methods, including 57 descriptive features and nine seasonal time series forecasting methods (i.e., one simple, five exponential smoothing, two state space and one automated autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average methods). We apply this framework to three global datasets originating from the larger Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata (GSIM) archives. As these datasets comprise over 13,000 monthly temperature, precipitation and river flow time series from several continents and hydroclimatic regimes, they allow us to provide trustable characterizations and interpretations of 12-month ahead hydroclimatic forecastability at the global scale. We first find that the exponential smoothing and state space methods for time series forecasting are rather equally efficient in identifying an upper limit of this forecastability in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, while the simple method is shown to be mostly useful in identifying its lower limit. We then demonstrate that the assessed forecastability is strongly related to several descriptive features, including seasonality, entropy, (partial) autocorrelation, stability, (non)linearity, spikiness and heterogeneity features, among others. We further (i) show that, if such descriptive information is available for a monthly hydroclimatic time series, we can even foretell the quality of its future forecasts with a considerable degree of confidence, and (ii) rank the features according to their efficiency in explaining and foretelling forecastability. We believe that the obtained rankings are of key importance for understanding forecastability. Spatial forecastability patterns are also revealed through our experiments, with East Asia (Europe) being characterized by larger (smaller) monthly temperature time series forecastability and the Indian subcontinent (Australia) being characterized by larger (smaller) monthly precipitation time series forecastability, compared to other continental-scale regions, and less notable differences characterizing monthly river flow from continent to continent. A comprehensive interpretation of such patters through massive feature extraction and feature-based time series clustering is shown to be possible. Indeed, continental-scale regions characterized by different degrees of forecastability are also attributed to different clusters or mixtures of clusters (because of their essential differences in terms of descriptive features).

AB  - Inter-basin water diversion projects have led to accelerated colonization of aquatic organisms, including the freshwater golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), exacerbating global biofouling concerns. While the influence of environmental factors on the mussel's invasion and biofouling impact has been studied, quantitative correlations and underlying mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in large-scale inter-basin water diversion projects with diverse hydrodynamic and environmental conditions. Here, we examine the comprehensive impact of environmental variables on the establishment risk of the golden mussel in China's 1432-km-long Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Logistic regression and multiclass classification models were used to investigate the environmental influence on the occurrence probability and reproductive density of the golden mussel. Total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, water temperature, pH, and velocity were identified as crucial environmental variables affecting the biofouling risk in the project. Logistic regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between the occurrence probability of all larval stages and levels of total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen. The multiclass classification model showed that elevated levels of total nitrogen hindered mussel reproduction, while optimal water temperature enhanced their reproductive capacity. Appropriate velocity and pH levels were crucial in maintaining moderate larval density. This research presents a quantitative analytical framework for assessing establishment risks associated with invasive mussels, and the framework is expected to enhance invasion management and mitigate biofouling issues in water diversion projects worldwide.

AB  - Accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial to understand the water cycle and partitioning of turbulent energy fluxes at the land surface. However, large-scale ET estimation is always difficult to achieve due to the complexity of controlling factors and the heterogeneity of landscapes. A recent model, referred to as the surface flux equilibrium (SFE) model, proposes that evaporative fraction (EF, the ratio of ET to available energy at the surface) can be estimated accurately from near-surface specific humidity and air temperature, which makes it applicable to common weather stations and climate reanalysis datasets. However, previous validation only focused on the evaluation of this model at site and basin scale for ET estimation, making the real performance of the SFE model for EF estimation heretofore unknown. There also exists a gap in the comparison between the SFE model and other existing products in the representation of global ET patterns and variation trend. Against this background, a comprehensive validation was performed in this study to evaluate the accuracy of the SFE model for both EF and ET estimation. The validation against 136 flux towers worldwide shows that the ground-based SFE model achieved EF estimation with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.22 and 0.16 at daily and monthly scale, respectively. The corresponding RMSE of ET estimation was 0.94 mm/day and 16.37 mm/month. The application of the SFE model on a global scale was achieved by using two reanalysis products (ERA5-Land and GLDAS-CLSM) as inputs respectively. The results indicate that the SFE model did hold potential to reduce the RMSE of these two products for ET estimation, but the cost was the decrease in correlation coefficient (r). The comparison with five existing global ET products (BESS, GLEAM, AVHRR, MOD16, and SSEBop) shows that the SFE model performed on the basis of ERA5-Land product has achieved moderate accuracy among these products. Judged from r, mean absolute error, RMSE, and bias, its accuracy was ranked as fourth, fourth, second, and second, respectively. However, a further evaluation over different land cover types suggests that the ERA-based SFE model has significant superiority over cropland, relative superiority over forest and savannas, and significant inferiority over shrubland and grassland. This analysis is the first global validation of the SFE model for EF estimation as well as its comparison with existing global ET products. The validation analysis proves that this simple model has generally achieved comparable accuracy to existing complex models in the representation of global ET patterns and variation trend.

AB  - An accurate estimation of spatially and temporally continuous global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is essential in the assessment of surface energy, water and carbon cycles. The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) ET product Version 4.0 (v4.0) based on the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was generated to estimate global terrestrial ET. However, certain uncertainty for the GLASS ET product v4.0 limits its application. In this study, we introduced the deep neural networks (DNN) merging framework to improve terrestrial ET estimation for GLASS ET product Version 5.0 (v5.0) generation by integrating five satellite-derived ET products [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET product (MOD16), Shuttleworth–Wallace dual-source ET product (SW), Priestley–Taylor-based ET product (PT-JPL), modified satellite-based Priestley–Taylor ET product (MS-PT) and simple hybrid ET product (SIM)]. We compared the performance of DNN method against other merging methods, including GLASS ET algorithm v4.0 (BMA), the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method and the random forest (RF) method, based on 195 global eddy covariance (EC) flux towers covering observations from 2000 through 2015. Validations indicated that the DNN had the highest accuracy among four merging methods across different land cover types, yielding the highest average determination coefficients (R2, 0.62), root-mean-squared-error (RMSE, 24.1 W/m2) and Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE, 0.77) with a of 99% confidence interval. Compared with GLASS ET algorithm v4.0, the DNN improved on the R2 by approximately 7% (p < 0.01) and the KGE by 10%. Based on the DNN, we then generated 8-day GLASS ET product v5.0 globally with a 1 km spatial resolution from 2001 to 2015 driven by GLASS vegetation and surface net radiation (Rn) datasets and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2) datasets. This global terrestrial ET product provides a valuable dataset for monitoring regional and global water resources and environmental changes.

AB  - Human activities have long impacted the health of Earth's rivers and lakes. These inland waters, crucial for our survival and productivity, have suffered from contamination which allows the formation and spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and consequently, ARG-carrying pathogens (APs). Yet, our global understanding of waterborne pathogen antibiotic resistance remains in its infancy. To shed light on this, our study examined 1240 metagenomic samples from both open and closed inland waters. We identified 22 types of ARGs, 19 types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and 14 types of virulence factors (VFs). Our findings showed that open waters have a higher average abundance and richness of ARGs, MGEs, and VFs, with more robust co-occurrence network compared to closed waters. Out of the samples studied, 321 APs were detected, representing a 43 % detection rate. Of these, the resistance gene 'bacA' was the most predominant. Notably, AP hotspots were identified in regions including East Asia, India, Western Europe, the eastern United States, and Brazil. Our research underscores how human activities profoundly influence the diversity and spread of resistome. It also emphasizes that both abiotic and biotic factors play pivotal roles in the emergence of ARG-carrying pathogens.

AB  - Water availability for agricultural practices is dynamically influenced by climatic variables, particularly droughts. Consequently, the assessment of drought events is directly related to the strategic water management in the agricultural sector. The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in different scenarios of climatic variables is a new approach that needs to be evaluated. In this context, the current research aims to forecast short-term drought i.e., SPI-3 from different climatic predictors under historical (1901–2020) and future (2021–2100) climatic scenarios employing machine learning (bagging (BG), random forest (RF), decision table (DT), and M5P) algorithms in Hungary, Central Europe. Three meteorological stations namely, Budapest (BD) (central Hungary), Szeged (SZ) (east south Hungary), and Szombathely (SzO) (west Hungary) were selected to forecast short-term agriculture drought i.e., Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-3) in the long run. For this purpose, the ensemble means of three global circulation models GCMs from CMIP6 are being used to get the projected (2021–2100) time series of climatic indicators (i.e., rainfall R, mean temperature T, maximum temperature Tmax, and minimum temperature Tmin under two scenarios of socioeconomic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP4-6.0). The results of this study revealed more severe to extreme drought events in past decades, which are projected to increase in the near future (2021–2040). Man-Kendall test (Tau) along with Sen’s slope (SS) also revealed an increasing trend of SPI-3 drought in the historical period with Tau = −0.2, SS = −0.05, and near future with Tau = −0.12, SS = −0.09 in SSP2-4.5 and Tau = −0.1, SS = −0.08 in SSP4-6.0. Implementation of ML algorithms in three scenarios: SC1 (R + T + Tmax + Tmin), SC2 (R), and SC3 (R + T)) at the BD station revealed RF-SC3 with the lowest RMSE RFSC3-TR = 0.33, and the highest NSE RFSC3-TR = 0.89 performed best for forecasting SPI-3 on historical dataset. Hence, the best selected RF-SC3 was implemented on the remaining two stations (SZ and SzO) to forecast SPI-3 from 1901 to 2100 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP4-6.0. Interestingly, RF-SC3 forecasted the SPI-3 under SSP2-4.5, with the lowest RMSE = 0.34 and NSE = 0.88 at SZ and RMSE = 0.34 and NSE = 0.87 at SzO station for SSP2-4.5. Hence, our research findings recommend using SSP2-4.5, to provide more accurate drought predictions from R + T for future projections. This could foster a gradual shift towards sustainability and improve water management resources. However, concrete strategic plans are still needed to mitigate the negative impacts of the projected extreme drought events in 2028, 2030, 2031, and 2034. Finally, the validation of RF for short-term drought prediction on a large historical dataset makes it significant for use in other drought studies and facilitates decision making for future disaster management strategies.

AB  - Climate vulnerability in the Indian region becomes a major concern due to the frequent hydro-meteorological extreme events throughout the year. The number of extreme rainfall events (ERE) associated with monsoon, thunderstorms and short-spanned local cloudbursts which are mainly ranges from a few hours to a few days, has increased in recent decades over the subcontinent. There is a need to quantify these high impact weather events and to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics and associated physical processes for the real time prediction for pro-active disaster management. This review paper highlights the various research works carried out and suggests the need of observation, modelling efforts for simulation/prediction of the EREs in the continental India. The works starting from cloudburst in the Himalayan region (Leh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) to the heavy rainfall in Kerala, Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai etc. as presented by earlier researchers are being reported in this compilation. The ERE intensity and frequency distribution in India are being analyzed using IMD gridded rainfall observation for 72 years. The analysis indicates the increasing trend in the intensity of daily rainfall during the ERE in the subcontinent. The current state of research in the multi-scale study of the ERE as well as their future changes based on climate model outputs are reviewed and the challenges are also reviewed. Evaluation of the capability of the state of art meso scale models like Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the simulation of such events at high resolution using the high-performance computing and the assimilation techniques are also emphasized in the recent research in this field. Along with the impact of large-scale physical processes like El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO), also the sensitivity of the urbanization, topography in the simulation of the convective meso-scale events is being presented and which indicated the down-scaled data are the best tool for the ERE research. This review will surely help the interdisciplinary researchers for the extreme analysis of the high impact hydro-meteorological disaster events.

AB  - There is an immediate need to develop accurate and reliable global hydrological forecasts in light of the future vulnerability to hydrological hazards and water scarcity under a changing climate. As a part of the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Global Hydrological Status and Outlook System (HydroSOS) initiative, we investigated different approaches to blending multi-model simulations for developing holistic operational global forecasts. The ULYSSES (mULti-model hYdrological SeaSonal prEdictionS system) dataset, to be published as “Global seasonal forecasts and reforecasts of river discharge and related hydrological variables ensemble from four state-of-the-art land surface and hydrological models” is used in this study. The first step for improving these forecasts is to investigate ways to improve the model simulations, as global models are not calibrated for local conditions. The analysis was performed over 119 different catchments worldwide for the baseline period of 1981–2019 for three variables: evapotranspiration, surface soil moisture and streamflow. This study evaluated blending approaches with a performance metric based (weighted) averaging of the multi-model simulations, using the catchment’s Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) for the variable to define the weight. Hydrological model simulations were also bias-corrected to improve the multi-model blending output. Weighted blending in conjunction with bias-correction provided the best improvement in performance for the catchments investigated. Applying modelled weights during blending original simulations improved performance over ungauged catchments. The results indicate that there is potential to successfully and easily implement the bias-corrected weighted blending approach to improve operational forecasts globally. This work can be used to improve water resources management and hydrological hazard mitigation, especially in data-sparse regions.

AB  - The rapid acceleration of the global water cycle caused by changes in global climate trigger complex processes that make conventional machine learning techniques limited in assessing impacts of such changes on terrestrial water storage (TWS). This study introduces an assimilated deep learning neural network to improve the modeling of TWS dynamics. Key predictors and inputs to this deep learning framework include runoff, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, global teleconnection patterns and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The proposed back propagation model in this study capitalizes on the availability of remotely sensed observations and model datasets to predict monthly TWS, a quantity that is difficult to observe in the field, but important for the estimation of regional water budget balance, and water resource management for agricultural purposes. By integrating pre-processed outputs from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into our network using a deep neural pattern, we synthesized TWS from 2002 to 2017, and also made future predictions using our trained models. Results from these analyses showed that the ICA-BPNN model has a higher predictive accuracy compared to the PCA-BPNN. These models (ICA-BPNN and PCA-BPNN) were used to fit the three dominant temporal patterns of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) – observed TWS over Africa. Our simulation results from the testing phase indicate that the fits for the prediction of the first three leading modes of TWS for both models when compared to the observed GRACE-TWS were PCA-BPNN1 (89%), PCA-BPNN2 (82%), PCA-BPNN3 (84%) and ICA-BPNN1 (93%), ICA-BPNN2 (88%), ICA-BPNN3 (82%). The simulation fit of the BPNN corresponding to multi-annual time series, which are captured in the second and third orthogonal modes and localized patterns of TWS were lower than those of annual signals in both the PCA- and ICA-BPNN models. This was attributed to the fact that the multi-annual time series in GRACE-hydrological signals of our test-bed are complex compared to the annual patterns of TWS. On the one hand, this exemplifies the superior performance of our predictive framework in modeling naturalized system (annual changes in TWS driven by only climatic factors). On the other hand, the complexity in modelling multi-annual variations in TWS suggests heavily disturbed naturalized systems evidenced in the presence of human water management operations among other anthropogenic activities.

Humid tropical forests play a dominant role in the functioning of Earth but are under increasing threat from changes in land use and climate. How forest vulnerability varies across space and time and what level of stress forests can tolerate before facing a tipping point are poorly understood. Here, we develop a tropical forest vulnerability index (TFVI) to detect and evaluate the vulnerability of global tropical forests to threats across space and time. We show that climate change together with land-use change have slowed the recovery rate of forest carbon cycling. Temporal autocorrelation, as an indicator of this slow recovery, increases substantially for above-ground biomass, gross primary production, and evapotranspiration when climate stress reaches a critical level. Forests in the Americas exhibit extensive vulnerability to these stressors, while in Africa, forests show relative resilience to climate, and in Asia reveal more vulnerability to land use and fragmentation. TFVI can systematically track the response of tropical forests to multiple stressors and provide early-warning signals for regions undergoing critical transitions.

AB  - Droughts are the most spatially complex geohazard, which often lasts for years, thereby severely impacting socio-economic sectors. One of the critical aspects of drought studies is developing a reliable and robust forecasting model, which could immensely help drought management planners in adopting adequate measures. Further, the prediction of drought events are extremely challenging due to the involvement of several hydro-meteorological factors, which are further aggravated by the effect of climate change. Among the several techniques such as statistical, physical and data-driven that are used to forecast droughts, artificial neural networks provide one of the most robust approach. As droughts are inherently non-linear and multivariate in nature, the capability of neural networks to capture the dynamic relationship easily and efficiently has seen a rise in its use. Here we evaluate the most used architectures in the last two decades, using scientometric analysis. A general framework used in drought prediction studies is explained and examples from various continents are provided, thus exploring the topic in a global context. The findings show that using sophisticated input representation, the artificial intelligence-based solutions applied to drought prediction of hydro-meteorological variables have promising success, particularly in complex geographical scenarios. The future works need to focus on interpretable models, use of deep learning architectures for long lead time forecasting and use of neural networks to predict different drought characteristics like drought propagation and flash droughts. We also summarize the most widely used neural network approaches in spatial drought prediction, which would serve as a foundation for future research in drought prediction studies.

AB  - Fluid loss to subsurface formations is a challenging aspect during drilling operations in petroleum industry. Several other drilling issues such as fluid influx and pipe sticking can be triggered in such scenarios, posturing a significant risk to rig personnel, environment, and economical drilling. Therefore, prediction and early detection of lost circulation events are required for safe and economic drilling operation. Several theoretical studies have been performed to detect and predict fluid loss event during hydrocarbon extraction. This paper reviews the existing conventional and intelligent models developed for early detection and prediction of lost circulation events. These predictive and detecting models comprise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that require improvements for data reduction, universal prediction and compatibility. The review also covers several sensor-based techniques, different geostatistical-based models and Pressure-While-Drilling (PWD) tools for their applications in early loss circulation detection. In addition, loss circulation zones types, severity level, scenario and common preventive measures are also included in this review. This study aims to provide a systematic review of the published literature from the last forty years on the developed conventional and intelligent models for detection and prediction of fluid loss events and emphasizes on increasing AI involvement for precise results.

AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a key variable in the global water balance, driving agricultural production and ecosystem health. It is a complex hydrologic process that depends on vegetation, climate, and available water conditions. Different moderate resolution global AET models have been developed to quantify water resources at large scales. In this work we evaluate five of these products, including MODIS, PML, SSEBop, TerraClimate, and a Synthesis AET using point and catchment-scale datasets based on flux towers. We also contrast water balance changes with total water storage (TWS) products. These comparisons cover different radiation and precipitation regimes over catchments around the world and along a strong climatic gradient in north-central Chile. We rank the models, contrast TWS datasets, and study differences related to scale in validation and the effect of rainfall and radiation on simulated values. Additionally, we use a Budyko framework to evaluate the AET products in terms of their agreement with expected water budgets. At different evaluation scales, AET estimates and observations agreed reasonably well, with the largest mean R2 of about 0.7 and errors of approximately 15% of the magnitude of the observed variables. MODIS and Synthesis AET had the highest R2 at the point (0.62) and at the catchment scales (0.71 and 0.59 for regional and global catchments), respectively, but were closely followed by PML. PML and TerraClimate led to the lowest magnitude errors at the point (RMSE = 0.78 mm day−1) and catchment scales (mean RMSE = 1.5 mm day−1), respectively. The rainfall gradient is reflected in a performance gradient. PML, MODIS, and TerraClimate gave consistent behaviour based on the Budyko curve, with a few arid catchments exceeding the water limit. The major conclusion is that remotely sensed AET outperforms flux tower AET extrapolation for water balance calculations at the catchment scale, which means that errors in satellite-based AET products tend to cancel out at larger spatial scales, which makes them viable alternatives for regional water balance studies. However, flux data integrated into AET models, such as the FluxCom model, leads to the lowest errors. The assimilation and downscaling of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) into the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) leads to an improvement in regional results compared with other TWS products.

AB  - Data-driven models have been widely developed and achieved impressive results in streamflow prediction. However, the existing data-driven models mostly focus on the selection of input features and the adjustment of model structure, and less on the impact of spatial connectivity on daily streamflow prediction. In this paper, a basin network based on graph-structured data is constructed by considering the spatial connectivity of different stations in the real basin. Furthermore, a novel graph neural network model, variational Bayesian edge-conditioned graph convolution model, which consists of edge-conditioned convolution networks and variational Bayesian inference, is proposed to assess the spatial connectivity effects on daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed graph neural network model is applied to forecast the next-day streamflow of a hydrological station in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Six comparative models and three comparative experimental groups are used to validate model performance. The results show that the proposed model has excellent performance in terms of deterministic prediction accuracy (NSE ≈ 0.980, RMSE≈1362.7 and MAE ≈ 745.8) and probabilistic prediction reliability (ICPC≈0.984 and CRPS≈574.1), which demonstrates that establishing appropriate connectivity and reasonably identifying connection relationships in the basin network can effectively improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecasting performance of the graph convolutional model.

AB  - Mounting environmental concerns have given rise to an increasing focus on renewable energies like biofuels. In 2018, three countries – China, the United States, and India – together emitted almost half (50.3%) of the world’s CO2 emissions (billion metric tons). The current study aims to forecast biofuels’ production, consumption, and self-sufficiency in these top CO2 emitting countries using a novel grey forecasting model. The study improves on an existing grey forecasting model by optimizing the model architecture (data accumulation operation and background value generation). The proposed forecasting model, EGM (1,1,α,θ), is a generalized form of the even form of the grey forecasting model, and its relative performance turned out to be generally superior to that of the original model. The comparative analyses of the proposed model with two forecasting models revealed that the new model’s forecast accuracy is generally better than those of others. The study finds, achieving self-sufficiency in both biofuels (fuel ethanol and biodiesel) would remain a challenge for China, while the United States and India would maintain their self-sufficiency in ethanol and biodiesel, respectively, at least till 2028. The study also argues that biofuel is more likely to be a complementary fuel rather than an alternative fuel. The study helps us understand how, in the next decade, the landscapes of biofuel production and consumption are changing, and concludes with significant policy implications.

AB  - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides an unprecedented way to assess terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) worldwide. However, hydroclimatic drivers of GRACE-derived TWSC in different climates have not been systematically examined, which hinders its applications in water resources management and hydrological model development. In this study, we derived the monthly TWSC using the GRACE dataset, and analyzed its partial correlations with precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and temperature (T) from 2003 to 2019 under the Köppen-Geiger world climate classification system. Relative contributions of the four hydroclimatic elements (P, ET, R, and T) to TWSC were quantified using the hierarchical partitioning method. The results indicate that P mainly controls TWSC in tropical climates, hot semi-arid climate, and temperate and continental climates with dry winter. ET is the primary driver of TWSC in mid- and high-latitude regions that feature temperate and continental climates with no dry season, subarctic climates, and polar climates. T mainly influences TWSC in cold arid climates, temperate and continental climates with dry summer or no dry season, and ice cap climate. However, TWSC in many arid climates near the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are not well explained by all four hydroclimatic variables according to their non-significant partial correlations. Large trends in annual TWSC are found in South America, western Canada, eastern contiguous United States, and Africa, which are likely due to marked changes in P based on their similar spatial pattern. In particular, decreasing TWSC are found in most continental climates, which manifests a deterioration of water resources availability in these regions. Overall, our results clarify the major hydroclimatic drivers of TWSC in different climates at a global scale, which may help improve TWSC modeling and prediction through a judicious selection of explanatory hydroclimatic variables in different climates.

AB  - Accurately quantifying large-scale terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) remains hampered by poor parameterization of the physical processes that relate to ET. Previous studies suggested that the calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) method that requires only routine meteorological data performed better than main-stream atmospheric reanalyses, land surface or remote sensing models in estimating large-scale ET. Here we simultaneously evaluate the latest machine learning-based upscaling of eddy-covariance measurements (FLUXCOM) and the CR estimates against the water-balance derived ET rates of 18 large Hydrologic Unit Code-2 (HUC2) and 327 medium HUC6 basins across the conterminous United States. Overall, CR and FLUXCOM perform comparably in representing the multiyear mean and temporal variations in annual ET at both, HUC2 and HUC6, scales for the 1979–2013 period. Such equally good skills also hold true for the 2003–2015 period, during which FLUXCOM was driven solely by remote sensing data. However, the CR generally captures the long-term linear tendencies in annual ET rates somewhat better than FLUXCOM. Because of its minimal data requirement, the calibration-free version of the CR may continue to serve as a benchmarking tool for large-scale ET simulations.

AB  - Recently, research interest has shifted to the development of effective remediation technologies for treated palm oil mill effluent (TPOME) due to the failure of the existing treatment methods to comply with the standard discharge limits. Photocatalytic technology has been recognized as an extremely attractive and sustainable technology for the remediation of TPOME. However, inefficient harvesting of visible or solar light, very low remediation efficiency under visible light, incomplete recovery of the photocatalyst after the treatment, lack of property-performance relationship, and lack of process understanding as well as parametric optimization are the major challenges which hinder the practical application of photocatalytic technology for the remediation of TPOME. Many investigations have been carried out to overcome the existing challenges and enhance the overall remediation efficiency of TPOME. This review provides an in-depth and critical analysis of the recently developed strategies to countermeasure the limitations and improve the overall performance of photocatalytic technology for the remediation of TPOME with respect to the preparation of visible light active photocatalyst, strategies to eliminate the need for the recovery of photocatalyst, and parametric optimization of the photocatalytic process. Various properties of the photocatalysts were reviewed and their correlation with the photocatalytic performance for the remediation of TPOME was evaluated. Also, the specific removal rate (mg of COD removed/g catalyst h) was calculated to provide an inclusive and quantitative comparison of individual studies using various photocatalysts, which are barely deliberated in the published literatures. Prospective research needs for resolving the major challenges and improving the competency of photocatalytic technology for practical application in remediation of TPOME are suggested accordingly. This review will enhance our understanding of the photocatalytic technology for the remediation of TPOME and extend the boundary towards the practical application of this technology on an industrial scale.

AB  - The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Global Water Sustainability (GEOGloWS) hydrologic model provides global river discharge hindcasts and daily forecasts at approximately one million subbasins worldwide. The model is meant to sustainably provide discharge data during emergency situations and to underdeveloped countries which do not have sufficient local capacity. The primary model error is biased flow magnitudes which reduce the usefulness of the results. We applied a revised implementation of the SABER bias correction method to correct GEOGloWS model results. SABER uses a combination of watershed clustering with machine learning, geospatial analysis, and statistics to generalize bias patterns in gauged basins so they can also be applied to ungauged basins. We validated the bias corrected data created using the improved SABER method at 12,965 gauges globally and showed that this method reduced the mean error at 90% of gauges. We present an analysis of the improved SABER method using several metrics including mean error, root mean squared error, and Kling Gupta Efficiency. We found that the GEOGloWS model is usually biased high but our results indicate a reduction in the bias of the GEOGloWS model worldwide. We evaluate the varied performance of the bias correction procedure and significance of the improvements which vary based on stream order the watershed classifications derived in our analysis. We provide guidance on the use of bias corrected global data to local scale applications and discuss implications for the GEOGloWS model in the future.

AB  - Deepwater drilling using high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) drilling fluids draws significant attention for the quest of increasing energy demand. In this regard, selecting appropriate drilling fluid plays a pivotal role in trouble-free and safe drilling operations. This study presents a comprehensive literature review on the performance of HPHT drilling fluids concerning the structure-property relationships of the drilling fluid additives. The advantages and disadvantages of the different categories of drilling fluids are presented. The significant features of the drilling fluids, such as their synthesis of additives, formulations, structure-property relationships, performances, process engineering, economics, and environmental aspects, are thoroughly discussed. Data for 84, 42, and 9 traditional HPHT, ultra-HPHT, and HPHT-hc drilling fluids are collected, analyzed for performance evaluation. In addition to the above drilling fluids, the performance of several high-performance drilling fluids involving ionic liquids, cationic surfactants, functionalized nanoparticles, and functionalized biopolymers are also deliberated. The present review highlights the current state in the industry, future position, and strategies for the researchers to follow. In conclusion, the top 10 high-performance HPHT drilling fluids are presented based on thermal stability, rheology, filtration loss control, lubricity, salt tolerance, and environmental aspects. It was found that the presence of (i) sulfonate, methyl, phenyl, furan, lactam, and pyrrolidine functional groups enhance thermal stability, (ii) amide, hydroxyl, cellulose derivatives, quaternary ammonium, and acrylate functional groups improve rheological performances, (iii) quaternary ammonium, pyridine, and cellulose derivatives maximize filtration control, (iv) sulfonate, acrylamide, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, itaconic acid, and fatty acid esters enhance the lubrication behavior, (v) carboxylate, sulfonate, quaternary ammonium functionality, polyoxyethylene chains prevent flocculation under HPHT environment, and (vi) carboxylic acid, and sulfonic acid salts improve salt tolerance power.

AB  - In water resources management, new computational capabilities have made it possible to develop integrated models to jointly analyze climatic conditions and water quantity/quality of the entire watershed system. Although the value of this integrated approach has been demonstrated so far, the limited availability of field data may hinder its applicability by causing high uncertainty in the model response. In this context, before collecting additional data, it is recommended first to recognize what improvement in model performance would occur if all available records could be well exploited. This work proposes a novel machine learning framework with physical constraints capable of successfully imputing a high percentage of missing data belonging to several environmental domains (meteorology, water quantity, water quality), yielding satisfactory results. In particular, the minimum NSE computed for meteorologic variables is 0.72. For hydrometric variables, NSE is always >0.97. More than 78 % of the physical-water-quality variables is characterized by NSE > 0.45, and >66 % of the chemical-water quality variables reaches NSE > 0.35. This work's results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness as a data augmentation tool to improve the performance of integrated environmental modeling.

AB  - Climate change and rapid urbanisation exacerbated multiple urban issues threatening urban sustainability. Numerous studies integrated machine learning and remote sensing to monitor urban issues and develop mitigation strategies for sustainability. However, few studies comparatively analysed joint applications of machine learning and remote sensing for urban issues and sustainability. This paper presents a systematic review and formulates a framework integrating machine learning and remote sensing in urban studies. The literature analysis reveals: Most studies occurred in Asia, Europe, and North America, driven by technical and ethical factors, highlighting responsible approaches for data-scarce regions; Reviewed studies prioritised physical spatial aspects over socioeconomic factors, requiring multi-source data for comprehensive analysis; Conventional satellite, aerial images, and Lidar data are prevalent due to affordability, quality, and accessibility; Although supervised machine learning dominates, unsupervised methods and algorithm selection paradigms require exploration; Integration offers accurate results and thorough analysis in image processing and analytics, while image acquisition and decision-making necessitate human supervision. This paper provides a comprehensive review and an integrative framework for machine learning and remote sensing, enriching insights into their potential for urban studies and spatial analytics. The study informs urban planning and policymaking by promoting efficient management via enhanced machine learning and remote sensing integration, and bolstering data-driven decision-making.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that, under the frame of sustainable farming, using the minimum water resources is a relevant requirement. In order to do that, precision irrigation aims at identifying the irrigation needs of plantations and irrigate accordingly. Artificial intelligence is a promising solution in this field as intelligent models are able to learn the soil moisture dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and then generating appropriate irrigation scheduling. This is a complex task as the phenology of plants and its water demand vary with soil properties and weather conditions. The present research contributes to this challenging task by proposing the application of neural networks in order to learn the time-series evolution of irrigation needs associated to a potato plantation. Several of such models are thoroughly compared, together with different interpolation methods, in order to find the best combination for accurately forecasting water needs. In order to predict the soil water content in a potato field crop, in which soil humidity probes were installed at 15, 30, and 45 cm depth during the whole cycle of a potato crop. This innovative study and its promising results provide with significant contributions to address the problem of predicting and managing groundwater for agricultural use in a sustainable way.

AB  - There has been an increase in the intensity of rainfall extreme events. These events have a high contribution to hazards in urban areas, such as flash flooding, and landslides, which lead to social, economic, and environmental damage. Sub-hourly rainfall information has a critical role in the assessment of such natural disasters. However, precipitation gauge networks in developing countries still lack high-quality data. This study presents a new automatic quality control procedure (A-QCP) for sub-hourly rainfall data in Brazil, analysing 7 years (2014–2020) of tipping bucket rain gauge (TBRG) data from over 3,000 gauges per year provided by CEMADEN’s (Brazilian National Centre for Monitoring and Early Warnings of Natural Disasters) rain gauge network as a case study. The A-QCP developed separately examines each year through a series of single-gauge tests in which each station was considered independently, going through procedures to assess possible equipment malfunctions through data analysis like long rainless periods or with constant tips due to clogging, spurious rainfall peaks, and long periods of missing data. Then, nearest neighbour analysis was performed through spatial outlier detection using Local Moran’s Index. The performance of the method was evaluated through a confusion matrix, which compared the procedures’ results with a reference dataset created using visual and independent analyses. After the application of the proposed A-QCP to the whole database, the results show that the procedure was able to correctly identify 78.6 % of faulty rain gauges for the whole period, with less than 8 % of functioning rain gauges removed from the final High-Quality database. It was also noted that the best performing filters were the first ones applied, showing that the procedure works best on the identification of gross errors, with diminished efficiency in finding malfunctions after the sequential removal of Poor-Quality rain gauges.

AB  - The abrupt rise in extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, droughts, etc.) due to changing climate in the last decades has increased the level of threats to various sectors (agriculture, energy, transportation, etc.) globally. The climate projections from global circulation models indicate even more intense and frequent extreme events in the future, which in turn pose more risks to socioeconomic infrastructure. The enhanced understanding of the climate-related financial risk associated with businesses has driven efforts to include critical information on probable risks associated with climate change in financial decision-making. In this study, we have presented a framework to assess the need of incorporating climate risk assessment as an integral part of business operations. We also reviewed revealed literature to understand the possible impacts of climate change on various sectors and presented key strategies to assess the climate risk associated with them. Also, a framework incorporating probable climate threats to business ecology with principles of robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy, and rapidity has been proposed to adapt and mitigate associated risks for a climate-resilient business ecosystem. The integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing risk could be a promising tool for enhancing business resilience to climate change and could be used as a tool. Robust and accurate predictions of climate and weather extremes from deep learning algorithms at a significant lead time can help in minimizing the associated risk with a business infrastructure. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), a weather extreme cause huge socioeconomic risk by triggering floods and droughts in various continents of mid-latitude regions. We have presented a case study investigating the ability of deep learning algorithms to predict ARs. The results from the analysis advocate the application of deep learning algorithms to predict weather and climate extremes in decision support systems to enhance the climate resilience of a business ecosystem.

AB  - Accurate precipitation (P) short-term forecasts are important for engineering studies and water allocation. This study evaluated a method for bias correction of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) of Global Ensemble Forecast System V2 forecasts based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model (M3) and 689 meteorological stations in seven different climatic regions of China. The method used a common deviation correction for multiple meteorological factors to forecast P for 1–8 d ahead. It was also compared with the equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching a single weather factor (EDCDFm, M1) and the XGBoost model (M2). The M3 method had the best forecast performance. M1, M2, and M3 methods had an average root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 2.292–17.049 mm, 1.844–18.835 mm, and 1.819–13.608 mm, respectively. The performance of each method tended to decrease as the lead time was extended. The average false alarm ratio (increased from 55.3%, 52.8% and 50.1% to 75.8%, 82.3% and 76.0%, respectively) and miss ratio (increased from 60.9%, 53.5% and 50.3% to 76.6%, 77.7% and 71.2%, respectively) also increased with an increased lead time for all methods. The forecast performance trended downwards from northwest to southeast China. However, each method’s significance in forecasting P’s determination coefficient showed a contrary pattern to the forecast accuracy. There was a general underestimation across the methods. The best performance for forecasting P was achieved in winter, with root mean square error values of 2.0–3.4 mm, followed in order by autumn > spring > summer. Factor P contributed the most to forecast P after bias correction of the XGBoost model (average Gain, Cover, and Frequency values of 0.55, 0.45, and 0.29, respectively). In summary, satisfactory performance could be obtained using the XGBoost model combined with multi-factor bias correction for NWP data to forecast daily P.

AB  - Cyanobacteria harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) in lakes and reservoirs represent a major risk for water authorities globally due to their toxicity and economic impacts. Anticipating bloom occurrence and understanding the main drivers of CyanoHABs are needed to optimize water resources management. An extensive review of the application of CyanoHABs forecasting and predictive models was performed, and a summary of the current state of knowledge, limitations and research opportunities on this topic is provided through analysis of case studies. Two modelling approaches were used to achieve CyanoHABs anticipation; process-based (PB) and data-driven (DD) models. The objective of the model was a determining factor for the choice of modelling approach. PB models were more frequently used to predict future scenarios whereas DD models were employed for short-term forecasts. Each modelling approach presented multiple variations that may be applied for more specific, targeted purposes. Most models reviewed were site-specific. The monitoring methodologies, including data frequency, uncertainty and precision, were identified as a major limitation to improve model performance. A lack of standardization of both model output and performance metrics was observed. CyanoHAB modelling is an interdisciplinary topic and communication between disciplines should be improved to facilitate model comparisons. These shortcomings can hinder the adoption of modelling tools by practitioners. We suggest that water managers should focus on generalising models for lakes with similar characteristics and where possible use high frequency monitoring for model development and validation.

AB  - Vegetation dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the complex interactions between climate variability, ecosystem changes and human land use. In this study, we use the Hindcasting Ecosystems Model (HEMO) to reconstruct the paleo Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (paleo-NDVI), which provides valuable insights into the historical vegetation patterns. Our research focuses on the El Alto Ancasti mountain range, a region characterized by its rich environmental diversity, and archaeological evidence of pre-Hispanic agricultural village landscapes, showcasing the knowledge and management of diverse environments and their fluctuations. To reconstruct the paleo-NDVI, we employed a Neuronal Network trained with two datasets. First, we utilized NDVI data extracted from AVHRR/NOAA satellite images spanning from 1982 to 2015, representing 8 km pixels from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies. Second, we incorporated growth ring chronologies from Northwest Argentina sourced from the International Tree Ring Data Bank, enabling the calibration of the NDVI-ring relationship. This methodology allowed us to reconstruct the paleo-NDVI back to 442 AD and to calculate anomalies. Our analysis revealed significant negative anomalies around 600 AD, coinciding with previous research conducted in the nearby Ambato valley. These anomalies may be attributed to the eruption of Tres Cruces volcano in Catamarca during that period. Additionally, extensive positive anomalies emerged from 1600 AD onwards, which align with anomalies detected in earlier studies. The eruption of Huaynaputina volcano in southern Peru in 1600 AD is a possible factor contributing to these positive anomalies. Ongoing investigations focusing on the paleoenvironment and human occupations in the El Alto-Ancasti area aim to provide further insights into how these detected changes could have influenced environmental management decisions. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, we can better comprehend the complex relationship between vegetation dynamics, climatic events and human activities, ultimately enhancing our understanding of past environmental transformations and their implications for sustainable management strategies.
