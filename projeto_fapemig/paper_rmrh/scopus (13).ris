AB  - [1] The generation of synthetic multivariate rainfall and/or streamflow time series that accurately simulate both the spatial and temporal dependence of the original multivariate series remains a challenging problem in hydrology and frequently requires either the estimation of a large number of model parameters or significant simplifying assumptions on the model structure. As an alternative, we propose a relatively parsimonious two-step approach to generating synthetic multivariate time series at monthly or longer timescales, by first transforming the data to a set of statistically independent univariate time series and then applying a univariate time series model to the transformed data. The transformation is achieved through a technique known as independent component analysis (ICA), which uses an approximation of mutual information to maximize the independence between the transformed series. We compare this with principal component analysis (PCA), which merely removes the covariance (or spatial correlation) of the multivariate time series, without necessarily ensuring complete independence. Both methods are tested using a monthly multivariate data set of reservoir inflows from Colombia. We show that the discrepancy between the synthetically generated data and the original data, measured as the mean integrated squared bias, is reduced by 25% when using ICA compared with PCA for the full joint distribution and by 28% when considering marginal densities in isolation. These results suggest that there may be significant benefits to maximizing statistical independence, rather than merely removing correlation, when developing models for the synthetic generation of multivariate time series.

AB  - Low flows result from the interplay of climatic variability and catchment storage dynamics, but it is unclear which of these variables is more relevant for explaining low flow spatial patterns. Here, we develop a new conceptual model that integrates process-based hydrological knowledge with statistics and test it for 1,400 Brazilian catchments. Through comparative hydrology, we isolate the low flow generating mechanisms and estimate their components using linear model trees. The model explains 58% of the spatial variance in 7-day minimum annual flows (Qmin) based on climate and catchment characteristics. The primary Qmin controls depend on the spatial scale of analysis. Catchment characteristics govern Qmin up to the continental scale (107 km2), where their relative importance matches that of climate. At subcontinental scales, catchment characteristics are twice as important as climate in predicting Qmin, suggesting that low flows are governed by the catchment's capacity to attenuate the climatic variability through water storage. Geological properties are the most important catchment characteristics, particularly bedrock type, lithology and topographic slope, determining streamflow recession rates in the dry season. Soil properties, primarily soil class and depth, are half as important as geology. Climate impacts Qmin mainly through mean annual rainfall minus evaporation, representing the potential groundwater recharge, while dry-season length has the lowest impact. These results hold mainly for highly seasonal and snow-free climates. Low flow hydrology that combines statistics with process understanding offers a promising framework for understanding regional low flow generating mechanisms and could support other estimation models than that presented here. © 2024.

AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used in a myriad of fields of research and development, including the predictability of time series. This work is concerned with one of such applications to simulate and to forecast stage level and streamflow at the Tamanduateí river watershed, one of the main tributaries of the Alto Tietê river watershed in São Paulo State, Brazil. This heavily urbanized watershed is within the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) where recurrent flash floods affect a population of more than 17 million inhabitants. Flash floods events between 1991 and 1995 were selected and divided up into three groups for training, verification and forecasting purposes. Weather radar rainfall estimation and telemetric stage level and streamflow data were input to a three-layer feed forward ANN trained with the Linear Least Square Simplex training algorithm (LLSSIM) by Hsu et al. [Hsu, K.L., Gupta, H.V., Sorooshian, S., 1996. A superior training strategy for three-layer feed forward artificial neural networks. Tucson, University of Arizona. (Technique report, HWR no. 96-030, Department of Hydrology and Water Resources)]. The performance of the ANN is improved by 40% when either streamflow or stage level were input together with the rainfall. The ANN simulated flood waves tend to be dominated by phase errors. The ANN showed slightly better results then a multi-parameter auto-regression model and indicates its usefulness in flash flood forecasting. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The variability of rainfall-dependent streamflow at catchment scale modulates many ecosystem processes in wet temperate forests. Runoff in small mountain catchments is characterized by a quick response to rainfall pulses which affects biogeochemical fluxes to all downstream systems. In wet-temperate climates, water erosion is the most important natural factor driving downstream soil and nutrient losses from upland ecosystems. Most hydrochemical studies have focused on water flux measurements at hourly scales, along with weekly or monthly samples for water chemistry. Here, we assessed how water and element flows from broad-leaved, evergreen forested catchments in southwestern South America, are influenced by different successional stages, quantifying runoff, sediment transport and nutrient fluxes during hourly rainfall events of different intensities. Hydrograph comparisons among different successional stages indicated that forested catchments differed in their responses to high intensity rainfall, with greater runoff in areas covered by secondary forests (SF), compared to old-growth forest cover (OG) and dense scrub vegetation (CH). Further, throughfall water was greatly nutrient enriched for all forest types. Suspended sediment loads varied between successional stages. SF catchments exported 455 kg of sediments per ha, followed by OG with 91 kg/ha and CH with 14 kg/ha, corresponding to 11 rainfall events measured from December 2013 to April 2014. Total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentrations in stream water also varied with rainfall intensity. In seven rainfall events sampled during the study period, CH catchments exported less nutrients (46 kg/ha TN and 7 kg/ha TP) than SF catchments (718 kg/ha TN and 107 kg/ha TP), while OG catchments exported intermediate sediment loads (201 kg/ha TN and 23 kg/ha TP). Further, we found significant effects of successional stage attributes (vegetation structure and soil physical properties) and catchment morphometry on runoff and sediment concentrations, and greater nutrients retention in OG and CH catchments. We conclude that in these southern hemisphere, broad-leaved evergreen temperate forests, hydrological processes are driven by multiple interacting phenomena, including climate, vegetation, soils, topography, and disturbance history. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The 1970s abrupt lake level rise of Laguna Mar Chiquita in central Argentina was shown to be driven by an increase in the Rio Sali-Dulce discharge outflowing from the northern part of the lake catchment. This regional hydrological change was consistent with the 20th century hydroclimatic trends observed in southeastern South America. However, little is known about the impacts of climate or land cover changes on this regional hydrological change causing the sharp lake level rise. To address this question, the present study aims to provide an integrated basin-lake model. We used the physically-based SWAT model in order to simulate streamflow in the Sali-Dulce Basin. The ability of SWAT to simulate non-stationary hydrological conditions was evaluated by a cross-calibration exercise. Based on observed daily meteorological data over 1973-2004, two successive 9-year periods referred to as wet (P1976-1985=1205mm/yr) and dry (P1986-1995=796mm/yr) periods were selected. The calibration yielded similar Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) at the monthly time scale for both periods (NSEwet=0.86; NSEdry=0.90) supporting the model's ability to adapt its structure to changing climatic situations. The simulation was extended in scarce data conditions over 1931-1972 and the simulation of monthly discharge values was acceptable (NSE=0.71). When precipitation in the model was increased until it reach the change observed in the 1970s (ΔP/P̄=22%), the resulting increase in streamflow was found to closely match the 1970s hydrological change (ΔQ/Q̄=45%). Sensitivity analyses revealed that the land cover changes had a minor impact on the 1970s hydrological changes in the Sali-Dulce Basin. Integrating the SWAT simulations within the lake model over 1973-2004 provided lake level variations similar to those obtained using observed discharge values. Over the longer period, going back to 1931, the main features of lake levels were still adequately reproduced, which suggests that this basin-lake model is a promising approach for simulating long-term lake level fluctuations in response to climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A terrestrial ecosystem model (integrated biosphere simulator (IBIS)) and a hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) are used in conjunction with long time series climate data to simulate the river discharge and flooded area of the Amazon/ Tocantins River basin over the last 60 years. Evaluating the results of this modeling exercise over the entire basin yields three major results: (1) Observations at 121 stations throughout the basin show that discharge is well simulated for most tributaries originating in Brazil. However, the discharge is consistently underestimated, by greater than 20%, for tributaries draining regions outside of Brazil and the main stem of the Amazon. The discharge underestimation is most likely a result of underestimated precipitation in the data set used as model input. (2) A new flooding algorithm within HYDRA captures the magnitude and timing of the river height and flooded area in relatively good agreement with observations, particularly downstream of the confluence of the Negro and Solimões Rivers. (3) Climatic variability strongly impacts the hydrology of the basin. Specifically, we find that short (∼3-4 years) and long (∼28 years) modes of precipitation variability drive spatial and temporal variability in river discharge and flooded area throughout the Amazon/Tocantins River basins.

AB  - Identifying the causes for historical sea-level changes in coastal tide-gauge records is important for constraining oceanographic, geologic, and climatic processes. The Rio de la Plata estuary in South America features the longest tide-gauge records in the South Atlantic. Despite the relevance of these data for large-scale circulation and climate studies, the mechanisms underlying relative sea-level changes in this region during the past century have not been firmly established. I study annual data from tide gauges in the Rio de la Plata and stream gauges along the Rio Parana and Rio Uruguay to establish relationships between river streamflow and sea level over 1931-2014. Regression analysis suggests that streamflow explains 59%±17% of the total sea-level variance at Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 28%±21% at Montevideo, Uruguay (95% confidence intervals). A long-term streamflow increase effected sea-level trends of 0.71±0.35mmyr-1 at Buenos Aires and 0.48±0.38mmyr-1 at Montevideo. More generally, sea level at Buenos Aires and Montevideo respectively rises by (7.3±1.8)×10-6m and (4.7±2.6)×10-6m per 1m3s-1 streamflow increase. These observational results are consistent with simple theories for the coastal sea-level response to streamflow forcing, suggesting a causal relationship between streamflow and sea level mediated by ocean dynamics. Findings advance understanding of local, regional, and global sea-level changes; clarify sea-level physics; inform future projections of coastal sea level and the interpretation of satellite data and proxy reconstructions; and highlight future research directions. Specifically, local and regional river effects should be accounted for in basin-scale and global mean sea-level budgets as well as reconstructions based on sparse tide-gauge records. © 2023 Christopher G.

AB  - This study reports on the performance of two medium-range streamflow forecast models: (1) a multilayer feed-forward artificial neural network; and (2) a distributed hydrologic model. Quantitative precipitation forecasts were used as input to both models. The Furnas Reservoir on the Rio Grande River was selected as a case study, primarily because of the availability of quantitative precipitation forecasts from the Brazilian Center for Weather Prediction and Climate Studies and due to its importance in the Brazilian hydropower generating system. Streamflow forecasts were calculated for a drainage area of about 51,900 km2, with lead times up to 12 days, at daily intervals. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index, the root-mean-square error, the mean absolute error, and the mean relative error were used to assess the relative performance of the models. Results showed that the performance of streamflow forecasts was strongly dependent on the quality of quantitative precipitation forecasts used. The artificial neural network (ANN) method seemed to be less sensitive to precipitation forecast error relative to the distributed hydrological model. Hence, the latter presented a better skill in flow forecasting when using the more accurate perfect precipitation forecast. The conceptual hydrological model also demonstrates better forecast skill than ANN models for longer lead times, when the representation of the rainfall-runoff process and of the water storage in the watershed becomes more important than the flow routing along the drainage network. In addition, results obtained by incorporating a quantitative precipitation forecast in both models performed better than the current streamflow obtained by the Brazilian national electric system operator using statistical models which do not utilize information on precipitation, whether observed or forecast. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The hydrometeorology of the Amazon basin in the ERA-40 reanalysis for 1958-2001 is compared with observations of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow. After 1979, the reanalysis over the Amazon has a small cool bias of the order of -0.35 K, and a small low bias of precipitation of the order of -0.3 mm day-1. In the early years (1958-72), there is a large upward drift in reanalysis precipitation and runoff associated with an upward drift in the atmospheric water vapor in the analysis, and a somewhat smaller downward drift of temperature as precipitation increases. In the presatellite data, there are inhomogeneities in the radiosonde and surface synoptic data, and there were problems with the variational analysis of humidity once satellite radiances were introduced. Approximate bias corrections can be made for precipitation and runoff on an annual basis, but this also removes some of the interannual variability. The reanalysis runoff-precipitation relationship is similar to the observed streamflow-precipitation relation, on an annual water-year basis. Compared to observations, ERA-40 precipitation for the Amazon is low by about 1.3 mm day-1 in the rainy season, and high by a smaller amount in the dry season. The precipitation bias produces a temperature bias in ERA-40 of the opposite sign on the annual time scale. The reanalysis has a small cold temperature bias after 1967, but on an annual time scale it reproduces the interannual variability of the observations. Although the biases in temperature and precipitation in recent decades are small, the difficulties with the analysis of atmospheric water vapor lead to large uncertainty in long-term trends of the water cycle. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - The electricity generation capacity in the Limay River basin is approximately 26% of the total electrical power generation in Argentina. Assessing the potential effects of climate change on the hydrological regime of this basin is an important issue for water resources management. This study explores the presence of trends in streamflow series, evaluates climate sensitivity and studies the effects on the flow regime of predicted changes in precipitation in the basin. In order to identify and quantify changes in observed streamflow series, the Mann-Kendall test, with a modification for autocorrelated data, and an estimator of the magnitude of the trend are applied. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in climate, the concept of elasticity is used. Precipitation elasticity of streamflow is used to quantify the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation and is estimated using a power law model and a linear statistical model in two sub-basins, Aluminé and Nahuel Huapi. The effects on flow regime of the predicted changes in precipitation under different scenarios are studied. Climatic results for different scenarios of growth in greenhouse gases from some General Circulation Models are used as inputs into the proposed models. The analysis identifies decreasing trends in mean and minimum annual flows and in the low flow season. The estimates of the precipitation elasticity imply that changes in precipitation produce similar changes in streamflow and the climatic results for different scenarios show that the variations are moderate. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Within a single region, it is possible to identify opposite changes in flow production. This proved to be the case for several basins in southeastern South America. It remains challenging to the causes this behavior and whether changes in streamflow will continue at current levels or decline in the coming decades. In this study, we used the Soil Water Assessment Tool to simulate monthly river discharge in the Ivaí River Basin, an unregulated medium-sized catchment and tributary of the Upper Paraná River Basin. After calibration, the simulated flow regime for the five streamflow stations based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) rated four of the streamflow stations Very Good (NSE between 0.86 and 0.89) and only one in the Good index (0.70). The overall flow behavior was well represented, although an underestimation was identified in four monitoring stations. Through assessment of its functionality and limitations in terms of specific flow duration curves percentages, the calibrated model could provide (to managers) the reliability needed for a realistic intervention. The results of this study may assist managers and support public policies for the use of water resources at the Ivaí River basin. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Better understanding the fate of the atmospheric carbon (C) captured by plant photosynthesis is essential to improve natural C flux modelling. Soils are considered as the major terrestrial bioreactor and repository of plant C, whereas channel networks of floodplain rivers collect and transport, throughout the aquatic continuum, a significant part of plant primary production until its export through outgassing or sequestration in marine sediments. Here, we show that river meandering in forested floodplains is a crucial and widely overlooked Earth surface process promoting C fluxes from the atmosphere to the aquatic continuum, via the floodplain vegetation. Over a recent period of 35 years (1984–2019), we quantified those C fluxes in one of the most active meandering rivers on Earth, the Ucayali River, Peru, South America. We used map time series combined with above-ground forest C data to derive the amount of C that is annually captured by the growing floodplain vegetation within the active meander belt, as well as exported to the aquatic continuum by lateral channel erosion. We found that the annual building and erosion of forested floodplain areas was nearly balanced over time with 19.0±7.7×103 ha−1 yr−1 and 19.8±6.7×103 ha−1 yr−1, respectively. While growing forests within the active meander belt annually captured 0.01±0.05×106 Mg C yr−1, lateral channel erosion provided the nearly 100-fold amount of C to the river channel and its streamflow, i.e. 0.9±0.4×106 Mg C yr−1. Our findings revealed that the migration of the Ucayali River channel provided nearly 10-times more lignified C per unit area to the aquatic continuum (44.7±21.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) than non-meandering central Amazonian floodplains do. Together, these findings point to the importance of quantifying the overall contribution of meandering rivers to natural C fluxes worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate variability and change in precipitation and streamflows of several Patagonian basins are analysed using both parametric and non-parametric tests and simulation models. Additional hydroclimatic (e.g. soil moisture, evapotranspiration, etc.) time series, obtained using a parametric monthly water balance model, were also analysed. The climate change characteristics are defined using results from several GCMs using a climate scenario generator (MAGICC/ SCENGEN software). All GCM model results for the region show increases in temperature but are more variable in their estimates of precipitation. Synthetic traces of hydroclimatic variables, based on the GCM results, were then generated as inputs to the rainfall-runoff model. A non-parametric technique was used to evaluate the feasibility of early detection of climate change impact in the traces. The impact of climatic precursors such as ENSO (El Niño/ Southern Oscillation) in the hydroclimatology of the Patagonian basins is also analysed in this work.

AB  - A groundwater/surface-water interaction model was developed for the shallow alluvial aquifer of the Choele Choel Island in Patagonia, Argentina. In this semiarid climate, agriculture is sustained by an irrigation/drainage system. During the irrigation season, seepage losses through unlined distribution canals in irrigated fields contribute to elevated groundwater levels, jeopardizing fruit productivity in some areas. Moreover, high stream stages during the irrigation season interfere with groundwater drainage. The model utilized MODFLOW and its stream package, and was successfully calibrated for a historical irrigation season. Modeling results indicate that drainage through streams is significantly higher than drainage through artificial drains. The stream/aquifer relationship proved very responsive to water table rises caused by irrigation. This response manifested as changes in the gaining/losing character of stream reaches. A synthetic run aimed at isolating the effect of streamflow changes on groundwater levels showed that the effect of higher streamflows dissipates toward the interior of the island, disappearing completely at the island center. Even though some results were qualitative, the model helped to provide a better understanding of the coupled system to elucidate some of the causes of a rising water table on the island. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - Estimates of the sensitivity of streamflow to climate are required to make informed decisions for managing water resources and environmental systems to cope with hydroclimatic variability and climate change. The precipitation elasticity of streamflow (εp), defined as the proportional change in mean annual streamflow divided by the proportional change in mean annual precipitation, is a measure of the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation. This paper uses a nonparametric estimator to estimate εp for over 500 catchments across the world. The nonparametric estimator calculates εp directly from concurrent historical annual catchment precipitation and streamflow data, and is particularly useful for global studies such as this because it does not require the selection of a single hydrological model and calibration criteria that are appropriate for catchments across the world. The results indicate that changes in precipitation are amplified in streamflow. The εp estimates generally range from 1.0 to 3.0, that is, a 1% change in mean annual precipitation results in a 1-3% change in mean annual streamflow. The higher εp values (greater than 2.0) are observed in southeastern Australia and southern and western Africa, while lower εp values (lower than 2.0) are observed in southwestern South America and at mid and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. There is a relatively strong inverse relationship between εp and runoff coefficient, with higher εp values observed in catchments with lower runoff coefficients. The εp value is also generally lower than 2.0 in catchments with high mean annual streamflow (greater than 500 mm) or mean annual precipitation (greater than 1500 mm), and in cold climates (mean annual temperature lower than 10°C).

AB  - The first aim of the present paper is the determination of the magnitude, annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in seasonal hindcasts of runoff and discharge in the entire continent of South America. We evaluated 35 years of hindcasts generated with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with SEAS5 hindcasts. Initial conditions of terrestrial water and so-called pseudo-observations were computed with a reference (i.e. historic) simulation. Skill was determined with monthly temporal resolution for the entire annual cycle and mostly using the pseudo-observations for verification. The second aim of the paper is the explanation of skill in terms of its sources, namely meteorological forcing and the initial conditions. Therefore, two sets of restricted hindcasts, which isolate the sources of skill, were analysed. The SEAS5 precipitation hindcasts exhibit significant skill even at the longest lead times (7 months). Beyond the first lead month we found significant skill in 13–43 % of the grid cells, depending on target and lead month. Levels of skill are higher in the full hindcasts (significant skill in 31–89 % of the grid cells). At the continental scale more of the skill is caused by the forcing than by the initial conditions. The runoff hindcasts are skilful in large parts of the continent. In a 1000 km wide band along the north coast of the continent and in southeast South America, most of the skill is due to the forcing. A typical feature of these regions is an increase of skill with lead time during specific parts of the year, which is against the common tendency. In Argentina and north Chile most of the skill in the runoff hindcasts can be attributed to the initial conditions of soil moisture. Verification with real observations of discharge broadly confirmed the skill pattern obtained with pseudo-observations. © 2022

AB  - A terrestrial ecosystem model (integrated biosphere simulator (IBIS)) and a hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) are used in conjunction with long time series climate data to simulate the river discharge and flooded area of the Amazon/ Tocantins River basin over the last 60 years. Evaluating the results of this modeling exercise over the entire basin yields three major results: (1) Observations at 121 stations throughout the basin show that discharge is well simulated for most tributaries originating in Brazil. However, the discharge is consistently underestimated, by greater than 20%, for tributaries draining regions outside of Brazil and the main stem of the Amazon. The discharge underestimation is most likely a result of underestimated precipitation in the data set used as model input. (2) A new flooding algorithm within HYDRA captures the magnitude and timing of the river height and flooded area in relatively good agreement with observations, particularly downstream of the confluence of the Negro and Solimões Rivers. (3) Climatic variability strongly impacts the hydrology of the basin. Specifically, we find that short (∼3-4 years) and long (∼28 years) modes of precipitation variability drive spatial and temporal variability in river discharge and flooded area throughout the Amazon/Tocantins River basins.

AB  - In hydrological forecasting, data assimilation techniques are employed to improve estimates of initial conditions to update incorrect model states with observational data. However, the limited availability of continuous and up-to-date ground streamflow data is one of the main constraints for large-scale flood forecasting models. This is the first study that assess the impact of assimilating daily remotely sensed surface water extent at a 0.1° × 0.1° spatial resolution derived from the Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) into a global rainfall-runoff including large ungauged areas at the continental spatial scale in Africa and South America. Surface water extent is observed using a range of passive microwave remote sensors. The methodology uses the brightness temperature as water bodies have a lower emissivity. In a time series, the satellite signal is expected to vary with changes in water surface, and anomalies can be correlated with flood events. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a Monte-Carlo implementation of data assimilation and used here by applying random sampling perturbations to the precipitation inputs to account for uncertainty obtaining ensemble streamflow simulations from the LISFLOOD model. Results of the updated streamflow simulation are compared to baseline simulations, without assimilation of the satellite-derived surface water extent. Validation is done in over 100 in situ river gauges using daily streamflow observations in the African and South American continent over a one year period. Some of the more commonly used metrics in hydrology were calculated: KGE’, NSE, PBIAS%, R2, RMSE, and VE. Results show that, for example, NSE score improved on 61 out of 101 stations obtaining significant improvements in both the timing and volume of the flow peaks. Whereas the validation at gauges located in lowland jungle obtained poorest performance mainly due to the closed forest influence on the satellite signal retrieval. The conclusion is that remotely sensed surface water extent holds potential for improving rainfall-runoff streamflow simulations, potentially leading to a better forecast of the peak flow. © 2016

AB  - Regional teleconnections permit cross-continental modeling of hydroclimate throughout the world. Tree-rings are a good hydroclimatic proxy used to reconstruct drought and streamflow in regions that respond to common global forcings. We used a multi-species dataset of 32 tree-ring width chronologies from Chile and Uruguay as a climate proxy to infer annual streamflow (Q) variability in the Negro River basin, a grassland-dominated watershed of lowland Southeastern South America. A positive linear correlation between tree-ring chronologies from Central Chile and annual Negro River instrumental streamflow from 1957 to 2012 indicated a cross-continental teleconnection between hydroclimate variability in Central Chile and Northeastern Uruguay. This relationship was mediated in part by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whereby the El Nino 3.4 Index was positively correlated with regional rainfall, annual tree growth, and Q anomalies. Despite the proximity of Uruguayan tree-ring chronologies to Negro River hydrometric stations, the Chilean tree-ring chronologies best predicted annual streamflow. Thus, using tree-ring data from four long-term moisture-sensitive chronologies of the species Cryptocarya alba in Central Chile (32–34°S), we present the first streamflow reconstruction (1890–2009) in the lower La Plata Basin. The reconstruction supports regional evidence for increasing frequency of extreme flood years over the past century in Uruguay. We demonstrate how climate teleconnections that mediate local hydroclimate variability permit the cross-continental reconstruction of streamflow, filling a major geographical gap in historical proxies for flooding and drought in grassland biomes of the southern hemisphere. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In this study, an object-based verification method was used to reveal the existence of systematic errors in three satellite precipitation products: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) for the austral summer 2002-2003 in the La Plata river basin, southeastern South America, were analyzed with the Contiguous Rain Area (CRA) method. Errors in storms intensity, volume, and spatial location were evaluated. A macroscale hydrological model was used to assess the impact of spatially shifted precipitation on streamflows simulations. PERSIANN underestimated the observed average rainfall rate and maximum rainfall consistent with the detection of storm areas systematically larger than observed. CMORPH overestimated the average rainfall rate while the maximum rainfall was slightly underestimated. TRMM average rainfall rate and rainfall volume correlated extremely well with ground observations whereas the maximum rainfall was systematically overestimated suggesting deficiencies in the bias correction procedure to filter noisy measurements. The preferential direction of error displacement in satellite-estimated MCSs was in the east-west direction for CMORPH and TRMM. Discrepancies in the fine structure of the storms dominated the error decomposition of all satellite products. Errors in the spatial location of the systems influenced the magnitude of simulated peaks but did not have a significant impact on the timing indicating that the system's response to precipitation was mitigating the effect of the errors.

AB  - The MERRA-2 atmospheric reanalysis product provides global, 1-hourly estimates of land surface conditions for 1980-present at ~50-km resolution. MERRA-2 uses observations-based precipitation to force the land (unlike its predecessor, MERRA). This paper evaluates MERRA-2 and MERRA land hydrology estimates, along with those of the land-only MERRA-Land and ERA-Interim/Land products, which also use observations-based precipitation. Overall, MERRA-2 land hydrology estimates are better than those of MERRA-Land and MERRA. A comparison against GRACE satellite observations of terrestrial water storage demonstrates clear improvements in MERRA-2 over MERRA in South America and Africa but also reflects known errors in the observations used to correct the MERRA-2 precipitation. Validation against in situ measurements from 220-320 stations in North America, Europe, and Australia shows that MERRA-2 and MERRA-Land have the highest surface and root zone soil moisture skill, slightly higher than that of ERA-Interim/Land and higher than that of MERRA (significantly for surface soil moisture). Snow amounts from MERRA-2 have lower bias and correlate better against reference data from the Canadian Meteorological Centre than do those of MERRA-Land and MERRA, with MERRA-2 skill roughly matching that of ERA-Interim/Land. Validation with MODIS satellite observations shows that MERRA-2 has a lower snow cover probability of detection and probability of false detection than MERRA, owing partly to MERRA-2's lower midwinter, midlatitude snow amounts and partly to MERRA-2's revised snow depletion curve parameter compared to MERRA. Finally, seasonal anomaly R values against naturalized streamflow measurements in the United States are, on balance, highest for MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim/Land, somewhat lower for MERRA-Land, and lower still for MERRA (significantly in four basins). © 2017 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Catchment scale hydrological process studies in southern Chile are of special interest as little research at this scale has been carried out in this region. In particular, the young volcanic ash soils, which are typical for this area, are not well understood in their hydrological behaviour. In addition, extensive land use changes require detailed knowledge of hydrological processes in disturbed as well as undisturbed catchments in order to estimate resulting risks of erosion, eutrophication, floods and droughts. This study focuses on data collection and experimental determination of relevant processes in an undisturbed forested catchment in the Andes of southern Chile. The here gained understanding of runoff generation can serve as a reference for comparison with sites subject to human intervention, improving estimation of the effects of land use change. Owing to the lack of long-term data for this catchment it was necessary to replace long time series by a multitude of experimental methods covering as many aspects of the runoff generation process as possible. The methods used in this investigation include: measurements of streamflow, rainfall, throughfall, water chemistry, soil water dynamics, groundwater dynamics, soil physics, soil mineralogy, geo-electrical sounding, and tracer techniques. Methods and equipment used during field campaigns are described and evaluated for usefulness versus expenditure (labour and financial costs). Selected results and the hypotheses developed from these findings are presented. The results suggest the importance of fast processes for rainfall runoff response on the one hand as well as considerable dampening effects of a large subsurface storage on the other hand.

AB  - A common term in the continental and oceanic components of the global water cycle is freshwater discharge to the oceans. Many estimates of the annual average global discharge have been made over the past 100 yr with a surprisingly wide range. As more observations have become available and continental-scale land surface model simulations of runoff have improved, these past estimates are cast in a somewhat different light. In this paper, a combination of observations from 839 river gauging stations near the outlets of large river basins is used in combination with simulated runoff fields from two implementations of the Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model to estimate continental runoff into the world's oceans from 1950 to 2008. The gauges used account ~58% of continental areas draining to the ocean worldwide, excluding Greenland andAntarctica. This study estimates that flows to the world's oceans globally are 44 200 (±2660) km3 yr-1 (9% from Africa, 37% from Eurasia, 30% from South America, 16% from North America, and 8% from Australia-Oceania). These estimates are generally higher than previous estimates, with the largest differences in South America and Australia-Oceania. Given that roughly 42% of ocean-draining continental areas are ungauged, it is not surprising that estimates are sensitive to the land surface and hydrologic model (LSM) used, even with a correction applied to adjust for model bias. The results show that more and better in situ streamflow measurements would be most useful in reducing uncertainties, in particular in the southern tip of South America, the islands of Oceania, and central Africa. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Stochastic representation of the inherent variability of streamflow processes, in particular the representation of drought regimes, is crucial for economical and reliable operation of the highly hydro-based Brazilian power generation interconnected system. Periodic Auto-Regressive streamflow models have been proposed as a good compromise between mathematical tractability and hydrological representations. In practice the use of classical approaches for identification of a PAR(p) model can provide unpleasant results, as it is in shown in the paper. The paper describes an improvement of the classical identification procedure for PAR(p) models which preserves the model's drought simulation ability and at the same time improves its hydrological consistency and is statistically parsimonious.

AB  - In this study, a model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to forecast the runoff of a meso-scale, partly glaciated (40%), Alpine catchment area in the southernmost Andes in Patagonia, Chile. The study area is located in a maritime climate with a mean annual air temperature of C + 5.7 °C and about 5500 mm of precipitation per year at sea level. The multilayer feed-forward network is designed to make use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to increase the speed of computation (convergence). Using climate data recorded at an automatic weather station nearby as well as water level records measured simultaneously, the ANN model was trained and verified using independent training and validation datasets. Parameters and the corresponding time lags were determined by statistical methods such as partial, cross- and autocorrelation. The results of the simulation confirm that the proposed model was able to identify the underlying non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the observed discharge. The correlation during validation shows a significant correlation coefficient of 0.98,and an RMSE of 0.02 m respectively. However, it is almost impossible to decipher the internal behaviour of ANN due to its black-box character. Nevertheless, valuable insights were gained in the complex input-output relationships, and the occurrence of dependencies between different input variables were detected using global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The results of the GSA were compared with those of multiple linear regression (MLR). While the performance of the ANN is much better than the MLR, both models return similar results in terms of the dependency of the discharge upon input variables. It was found that despite the large proportion of glaciated surface area within the catchment, discharge is mainly controlled by precipitation (49%). Furthermore, the runoff is slightly influenced by temperature (19%), global radiation (15%) and wind speed (16%). While the ANN proves to be a very efficient tool for simulating runoff in glacerized, Alpine catchments from meteorological data, the GSA method, as outlined and used in this paper, offers a useful approach of analysing ANN output.

AB  - The main components of the hydrologic cycle of the La Plata basin in southeastern South America are investigated using a combination of observations, satellite products, and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) global reanalyses. La Plata basin is second only to the Amazon basin in South America in river discharge and size and plays a critical role in the economies of the region. It is a primary factor in energy production, water resources, transportation, agriculture, and livestock. Of particular interest was the evaluation of the annual cycle of the hydrologic cycle components. The La Plata annual-mean river discharge is about 21 000 m3 s-1, and the amplitude of its mean annual cycle is small: it is slightly larger during late summer, but continues with large volumes even during winter. The reason for this is that different precipitation regimes over different locations contribute to the total river discharge. One regime is found toward the northern boundary, where precipitation peaks during summer in association with the southernmost extension of the monsoon system. A second one is found over the central part of the basin, where precipitation peaks at different times in the seasonal cycle. Further analysis of the main tributaries of La Plata (Paraná, Uruguay, and Paraguay) reveals that each has a well-defined annual cycle but with different phases that can be traced primarily to each basin's physiography and precipitation regime. Interannual and interdecadal variability of the basin's precipitation is amplified in the variability of streamflow by a factor of 2, implying a high sensitivity of the hydrologic system to climate changes like those observed in the last few decades. This becomes more important when considering the large variability of streamflow: for example, the historical maxima of river discharge during the year following the onset of El Nino can triple the typical mean river discharge. A crucial component of the atmospheric water cycle, the low-level jet east of the Andes, supplies moisture from tropical South America to La Plata basin throughout the year. In lower latitudes, the jet has the greatest intensity during summer, but south of about 15°S there is a phase shift and the largest moisture fluxes are found during winter and spring. This is an uncommon feature not observed in other regions like the Great Plains of the United States, where the low-level jet develops only during the warm season.

AB  - We assess the potential benefits from innovative forecasts of the stream flows that replenish reservoirs in the semi-arid state of Ceará, Brazil. Such forecasts have many potential applications. In Ceará, they matter for both water-allocation and participatory-governance issues that echo global debates. Our qualitative analysis, based upon extensive fieldwork with farmers, agencies, politicians and other key actors in the water sector, stresses that forecast value changes as a society shifts. In the case of Ceará, current constraints on the use of these forecasts are likely to be reduced by shifts in water demand, water allocation in the agricultural Jaguaribe Valley, participatory processes for water allocation between this valley and the capital city of Fortaleza, and risk perception. Such changes in the water sector can also have major distributional impacts. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Relationships between environmental variables associated with the spread of vector-borne pathogens, such as RNA viruses transmitted to humans and animals, remain poorly understood. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is caused by a vector-borne, zoonotic RNA virus (VSV) and is the most common vesicular disease affecting livestock (domestic horses, cattle, pigs) throughout the Americas. This investigation focused on explaining patterns of more than 1500 VS-infected livestock premises in the western USA from 2004 to 2016 related to the ecology of the host-vector-virus-environment system. We investigated the relationship between VS incidents and habitat characteristics expected to be important to insect vectors: stream location, streamflow conditions, climate, and vegetation. Results show that VS incidents were distributed near the stream network with 72% located within 1 km of lotic habitat. Monthly incidents were closest to lotic habitat in April (x = 525 m) and furthest from lotic habitat in November, December and January (1843, 2141 and 4807 m) indicating that initial infection near streams may spread away from these locations. All first incidents (n = 35) occurred following peak annual streamflow, with 89% (31 of 35) of these occurring after streams returned to baseflow. This finding indicated that surveillance for VS could be targeted spatially in locally relevant geographic areas (that is, near streams) and temporally relative to local streamflow conditions which can be remotely monitored via existing web-accessible information networks. Habitat modeling of 11 subwatersheds revealed somewhat different models for each watershed with several factors important in multiple watersheds. In nine of the 11 watersheds, the highest model PC (31–71%) represented either higher-than-average long-term mean temperature or lower-than-average long-term mean precipitation. Approaching habitat modeling on a watershed basis reveals information to support additional research. These spatial and temporal relationships showcase the importance of hydrologic contributions to the emergence and distribution of an arthropod-borne disease in the western USA. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents the methodologies employed to generate monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasts for the State of Ceará, Brazil. The procedure uses a variety of linked models. Seasonal climate forecasts provided by the General Circulation Model ECHAM 4.5 are used to feed two regional atmospheric models, the Regional Spectral Model (RSM) and the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), that provide monthly and seasonal regional precipitation forecasts for the State. These precipitation forecasts are then interpolated into a finer resolution grid to estimate the monthly-averaged basin precipitation. A bias-correction procedure is applied to these forecasts so they can be used by a conceptual lumped hydrological model to generate monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasts for several sites within the State. The paper also discusses the bias-correction procedures applied for the precipitation forecast, the estimation of the hydrological model parameters for ungauged sites, and the use of ensemble forecasts.

AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of climate change on the hydroelectric potential of various basins across South America. Three different downscaled global climate models are used to estimate the percentage changes in rainfall and streamflow by the 2030s and 2080s under a high emission scenario in comparison to 1961–1990 baseline data. While rainfall is projected to increase slightly over the Uruguay River basin, rainfall over the Amazon and Brazil's Northeast region is expected to decline. As a consequence of climate change, streamflow in the São Francisco River, Tocantins River and Parnaiba River is projected to decline 46%, 31% and 26%, respectively in the coming 3 decades compared to data from 1961 to 1990. Furthermore, the increasing demands for water from the São Francisco River could become greater than available streamflow by the 2030s. Additionally, one of the three climate models indicated that the São Francisco and Parnaiba Rivers’ streamflow and hydroelectric production could potentially cease in the second half of the 21st century. Despite some inconsistencies between the long term projections from the 3 different climate models, the results of this research are important in the context of regional climate change, agricultural and energy resource planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The integrated assessment of stream networks and terrestrial land use contributes a critical foundation for understanding and mitigating potential impacts on stream ecology. Riparian zone delineation and management is a key component for regulating water quality, particularly in agricultural watersheds. We present a national assessment of riparian zone land uses according to stream order for the entire hydrological network in the Uruguayan landscape in Southeastern South America. We classified over 82,500 km of streams and rivers in Uruguay into seven Strahler order classes and delineated riparian buffers of 100 and 500 m, depending on stream order, covering a total of 13% of the terrestrial land area in Uruguay. Natural vegetation cover in riparian zones averaged 77% among basins, whereby natural grassland dominated first and second order stream buffers at 58% and 49%, respectively. This highlighted the importance of grasslands in headwater regions of the country. Riparian forests formed corridors along larger streams, representing a mere 9% of buffers in first order streams but reaching 46% of buffers of 6th order streams. Among the six major basins of Uruguay, we found differences in the relative importance of riparian forests and crop cover in headwater stream riparian zones, as well as differences in relative crop cover within riparian zones. Results show that streams in subtropical grassland landscapes originate in open grassland environments, which has major implications for thermal regimes, carbon inputs, and stream biodiversity. Riparian buffer management should consider geographic differences among different basins and ecoregions within Uruguay. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado biome (BCB) is among 25 biodiversity hotspots identified worldwide, and covers the recharge area of important aquifers and rivers in South America. The increase in deforestation has been threatening water availability in this region. In order to assist in the water-resource management of the BCB, this study models the daily streamflow in a basin of the Cerrado, using two approaches: a process-based model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool-SWAT) and the data-driven model (Artificial Neural Network-ANN). The performance of the models was evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2 ) and flow-duration-curves (FDC). The results indicate that SWAT (NSE > 0.61; R2 > 0.68) and ANN (NSE > 0.91; R2 > 0.79) models are suitable tools in daily streamflow modeling of the studied basin, with the ANN model being the most accurate. Based on FDC, the ANN model was also better than the SWAT model for all frequencies evaluated. Thus, the ANN model is a promising new approach for daily streamflow modelling in this region. Moreover, the results of this study can help water-resource managers in planning and implementing appropriate water allocation and conservation measures in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. © 2021, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

AB  - In recent years, a new discipline known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged, which has followed the growing trend experienced by Artificial Intelligence over the last decades. There are, however, important gaps in the adoption of XAI in hydrology research, in terms of application studies in the southern hemisphere, or in studies associated with snowmelt-driven streamflow prediction in arid regions, to mention a few. This paper seeks to contribute to filling these knowledge gaps through the application of XAI techniques in snowmelt-driven streamflow prediction in a basin located in the arid region of north-central Chile in South America. For this, two prediction models were built using the Random Forest algorithm, for one and four months in advance. The models show good prediction performance in the training set for one (RMSE:1.33, R2: 0.94, MAE:0.55) and four (RMSE: 5.67, R2:0.94, MAE: 1.51) months in advance. The selected interpretation techniques (importance of the variable, partial dependence plot, accumulated local effects plot, Shapley values and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) show that hydrometeorological variables in the vicinity of the basin are more important than climate variables and this occurs both for the dataset level and for the months with the lowest streamflow records. The importance of the XAI approach adopted in this study is discussed in terms of its contribution to the understanding of hydrological processes, as well as its role in high-stakes decision-making. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Dam construction in developing nations is on the rise. Monitoring these dams is essential to understanding downstream hydrologic impacts and for better planning and management of water resources. Satellite observations and advancements in information technology now present a unique opportunity to overcome the traditional limitations of reservoir monitoring. In this study, a global reservoir monitoring framework was developed as an online tool for near real-time monitoring and impact analysis of existing and planned reservoirs based on publicly available and global satellite observations. The framework used a mass balance approach to monitor 1598 reservoirs in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Simulated streamflow of the developed tool was validated in 25 river basins against a multidecadal record of in-situ discharge. The simulated storage change was validated against in-situ data from 77 reservoirs. The framework was able to capture reservoir state realistically for more than 75% of these reservoirs. At most in-situ gaging locations, the reservoir tool was able to capture streamflow with a correlation of more than 0.9 and a normalized root mean square error of 50% or less. The tool can now be used to study existing or planned reservoirs for short and long-term decision making and policy analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forecasts of inflow into major reservoirs of the Brazilian hydroelectric power system are essential to the operation planning of this system. Medium range forecasts of the order of a few days to two weeks were usually obtained by simple ARMA models, which do not include information of observed or forecast precipitation. We present results obtained by using a methodology based on one-way coupling of the ETA regional atmospheric model run by the Brazilian Center for Weather Prediction with a large-scale hydrological model in three sub-basins of the Parana River basin. Results were compared to the currently used ARMA model, showing that reductions in errors of inflow forecasts could be obtained. Comparison of results in different sub-basins suggests that the quality of rainfall forecasts depends on climate. Copyright © 2007 IAHS Press.

AB  - Interannual-to-decadal predictability of the Paraná river in South America is investigated by extracting near-cyclic components in summer-season streamflows at Corrientes over the period 1904-1997. It is found that oscillatory components with periods of about 2-5, 8 and 17 years are accompanied by statistically significant changes in monthly streamflow. Autoregressive predictive models are constructed for each component. Cross-validated categorical hindcasts based on the 8-yr predicted component are found to yield some skill up to four years in advance for below-average flows. A prediction based upon the 8- and 17-yr components including data up to 1999 suggests increased probability of below-average flows until 2006.

AB  - As part of a research project aimed to improve medium-range streamflow forecasts used in the operational planning of Brazilian hydroelectric power systems, a large-scale distributed hydrological model has been used to obtain streamflow forecasts for up to 12 days in advance using observed and predicted precipitation data. Observed streamflow data up to the time of forecast start were used to update state variables calculated by the model. This data assimilation was performed by applying an empirical procedure. Several configurations of this empirical procedure have been tested and this paper presents results obtained in applying it to the Rio Grande basin, one of the test beds of the Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX), focusing on forecasts at Furnas sub-basin (51 900 km2). Results show that flow forecasts were not improved by updating state variables related to river flow, while significant improvements were obtained by updating state variables related to groundwater storage.

AB  - Alternative climate products, such as gauge-based gridded data, ground-based weather radar, satellite precipitation and climate reanalysis products, are being increasingly applied for hydrological modelling. This review aims to summarize the studies that have evaluated alternative climate products within Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) applications and to propose future research directions, primarily for modelers who wish to study limited gauge, ungauged or transnational river basins. A total of 126 articles have been identified since 2004, the majority of which have been published within the last five years. About 58% of the studies were conducted in Asia, mostly in China and India, while another 14% were reported for United States studies. CFSR and TRMM are the most popular applied products in SWAT modelling, followed by PERSIANN, CMADS, APHRODITE, CHIRPS and NEXRAD. Generally, the performance of climate products is region-dependent; e.g., CFSR typically performs well in the United States and South America, but performs more poorly for Asia, Africa and mountainous basin conditions, as compared to other products. In contrast, the CMADS, TRMM, APRHODITE and NEXRAD have shown the strongest capability for supporting SWAT modelling in these regions. However, most of the evaluated products contain only precipitation input; therefore, merging reliable precipitation with CFSR-temperature is recommended for hydro-climatic modelling. Future research directions include: (1) examination of optimal combinations; e.g. CHIRPS-precipitation and CFSR-temperature, for simulating streamflow in different types of river basins; (2) development of a standardized validation scheme which incorporates the commonly accepted products, statistical approaches and temperature variables; (3) further evaluation of existing climate data products to accurately capture extreme events, pattern and indices as well as WGEN statistics; (4) improvement of climate data in terms of averaging approach, bias correction and additional factors or indices integration; and (5) bias correction of CMIP6 climate projections using the optimal climate data combinations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Uruguay has encouraged the development of the forestry sector since 1989. As a member of the Montreal Process, the country has followed a set of criteria and indicators for the Sustainable Forest Management. The aim of this paper is to describe the studies carried out in a large basin of 2097 km2, located in an area of humid subtropical climate and 1300 mm of long-term mean annual rainfall, where the conversion of natural grasslands to forests increased up to 540 km2 during the last 15 years. Using data from daily rainfall and streamflow, the study analyses the effects of afforestation on the runoff and water loss. The analysis comprises hydrographs resulting from comparable rainfall events and annual and seasonal streamflow and water loss behaviour, both before afforestation (1975-1993) and during the afforestation period (1994-2008). A statistically significant reduction of runoff volumes (33-43%) and peak flows (59-65%) were identified on storm hydrographs. The annual and seasonal streamflow also showed diminishing tendencies due to the forestry development, whereas the water loss increases. The annual streamflow decreased between 8.2 and 36.5% depending on the annual rainfall totals. The streamflow reduction was higher during spring and summer (25.2-38.4%) and smaller during autumn and winter (15-20.3%). The water loss is expected to increase by 98 mm for the long-term mean annual rainfall. The resulting information is a valuable input for the Integrated Water Resources Management of the Negro river basin located downstream, where hydroelectric power, rice irrigation and forestry development are supported.

AB  - Study Region: Forty-one river basins in Brazil and neighboring countries in South America. Study Focus: In large river basins, on countrywide or continental scales, it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate long time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available. However, these are needed to calibrate hydrological models and to run hydrological simulations continuously in real-time streamflow forecasting. In this study, we assess two real-time precipitation products based on rain gauges and satellite data (TRMM-MERGE and CPC-NOAA) for their use in streamflow forecasting in the hydropower sector in Brazil. To take advantage of each precipitation data source and derive a unique dataset, a methodology is proposed to combine, extend, and validate the datasets. We consider the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and robust reference for hydrological applications. Observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending, while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The proposed blending method, which uses the uncertainty of the original datasets to define the weighting factors, was efficient in generating a precipitation product that performs better than each dataset separately when used to force a hydrological model. The use of the double-mass curve correlation to extend the time series of the datasets beyond their common period allowed us to produce long time series of precipitation for South American basins and hydrological applications. The study shows that it is possible to rely on river discharge data and hydrological modeling to select and combine different precipitation products in the region and presents a step-by-step methodology to do so. © 2022

AB  - Assessing the regional and local impacts of climate changes on rainfall and streamflow patterns is often challenging, as most results tend to be very dispersed and inconsistent across models. We offer a complementary alternative for climate change impact studies by focusing primarily on climate indices. In particular, we analyse the historical and future variability of key climate indices associated with the South America Monsoon System (SAMS) as simulated by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. We use climate indices related to the tropical Atlantic interhemispheric surface temperature gradient, associated with the meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), as well as the land-ocean temperature contrast in the tropical Atlantic-South America region, and the intensity and position of the South Atlantic Subtropical High (SASH). We selected 14 CMIP5 models to estimate climate indices for the retrospective period (1980–2005) and future period (2006–2099), the latter under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. For comparison purposes during the retrospective period, the indices were also calculated using data from the Era-Interim reanalysis. The seasonal behaviour of the Era-Interim based indices is well reproduced by CMIP5 models, although the magnitude is significantly higher. For the future period, most models under both scenarios showed a consistent and asymmetrical intensification of the dipole index, suggesting, in a future climate, a potential wider displacement of the ITCZ during its seasonal cycle. As for the land-ocean contrast index, the CMIP5 simulations indicated consistent increase in the magnitude for the positive phase (land warmer than ocean) and a decrease for the negative phase (land colder than ocean). Finally, CMIP5 models consistently predict a strengthening and southward displacement of the SASH centre. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal future changes in climate indices associated with the SAMS that shows relevant coherences across models and scenarios. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society

AB  - River flooding is among the costliest natural disasters with severe economic, societal, and environmental consequences. However, substantial uncertainties remain in global and regional projections of future flood conditions simulated by global climate models (GCMs) and/or global hydrological models (GHMs). Using physical models coupled with machine learning (ML), for the first time, we project changes in flood magnitudes of 2062 global river basins by constraining physical-based streamflow simulations with observations under 1.5°C and 2°C warming scenarios identified for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We found that, during the validation period, the GHMs-simulated flood magnitudes would improve with reduced uncertainty over the selected river basins after ML with a Long Short-Term Memory network. Our estimation suggested that flood magnitudes would increase in many Northern Hemisphere mid- and high-latitude rivers (e.g., Lena River, Amur River and Volga River) but decrease in some river basins in southern Finland and Eastern Europe in future periods (i.e., 1.5°C and 2°C warming levels). In 1.5°C and 2°C warmer worlds, the decreasing flood magnitudes in most South American rivers are associated with decreased soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration induced by warmer temperatures. Although the geographical pattern of changes in flood magnitudes for the +2°C experiment is close to that of the +1.5°C experiment, a 1.5°C warming target is more likely to reduce flood magnitudes of many river basins worldwide (e.g., in central and eastern Siberia, Alaska/Northwest Canada and South America). © 2021.

AB  - Water resources availability presents a high degree of uncertainty in the context of climate change. In this study, the multi-year variability of simulated streamflow for three rivers (Paraná, Uruguay and Negro) in the La Plata Basin (LPB) in the period 1991-2098 is analysed. Simulated streamflow for that period were produced in a two-stage process involving a regional climate model (RCM) and a distributed hydrology model (VIC (variable infiltration capacity)). Outputs from two RCMs (PROMES [Spanish acronym for mesoscale forecast] and RCA [Rossby Centre regional atmospheric climate model]) were used in order to assess the sensitivity of the results to different models. Various spectral methods (singular spectrum analysis, maximum entropy method and multi-taper method) were used in order to detect low-frequency variability modes and preferred quasi-periodicities for annual and seasonal simulated time series. Both simulations generate larger runoff for the twenty-first century than those observed for the twentieth century for the three rivers. For annual time series, the variability in timescales longer than 30 years is detected by one of the simulations for the three rivers, and only weakly for the Negro River in the other. Seasonal variations of the preferred modes of multi-annual variability are apparent. The River Paraná shows a persistent 10-year period during most of the year in the PROMES-VIC simulation. No LFV modes were found for any trimester in any river for PROMES-VIC, while for RCA-VIC simulations, these appeared in austral summer (Negro and Uruguay rivers) or early winter (Paraná River). A striking finding, both for annual and seasonal simulated time series, is the conspicuous presence of pseudo-periods in the 2.5-5 years band that had already been captured in the observed 20th streamflow time series [Maciel, F., Díaz, A., and Terra, R., 2013. Multi-annual variability of streamflow in La Plata Basin. Part I: observations and links to global climate. International Journal of River Basin Management, 11 (4), 345-360.]. This pattern is probably linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. These results imply that the well-known relationships between ENSO and precipitation and streamflow anomalies in the LPB are expected to prevail during the twenty-first century. © 2014 © 2014 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

AB  - The predictability of the Magdalena River seasonal streamflow anomalies is evaluated using previous Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Precipitation (Pt) and Temperature over land (Tm) seasonal anomalies. Through a moving correlation analysis of 30 years, several regions that show stable significant teleconnections between the seasonal streamflow and SST, Pt and Tm from previous seasons have been identified during the period 1936-2009. For lags from one to four 3-month seasons (i.e. up to one year) for the SST and one to two seasons (i.e. up to six months) for Pt and Tm, the Magdalena River seasonal streamflow presents significant and stable correlations with the tropical Pacific SST (El Niño region), with Pt in South America and with Tm over the north of South America, mainly at lags of one and two seasons. The first PCs resulting from the significant and stable regions of the SST, Pt, and Tm fields are used in a forecast scheme to predict seasonal streamflow anomalies. The prediction based on this scheme shows an acceptable prediction skill and represents a relative improvement compared with the predictability of teleconnection indices associated with El Niño, which are traditionally used to predict streamflow in the country. This improvement is particularly more noticeable when lag between streamflow and predictors increases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Uruguay River basin experienced extensive land use change during the second half of the twentieth century as a result of expansion of agricultural area, while streamflow and precipitation increased during the same period. This study assesses the impact of land use change between 1960 and 2000 on streamflow using a hydrology model that explicitly accounts for the role of land cover. Although the model suggests that land use change could have large effects on streamflow, changes in mean streamflow are attributable to climatic variations and not to land cover change. On the other hand, a faster runoff response to precipitation was observed toward the end of the period, which does appear to be attributable to land cover change. Overall, however, the positive trend observed in the Uruguay River streamflow during the second half of the past century should be attributed to increased precipitation, rather than land cover change.

AB  - The existence of low-frequency variability in climatic-hydrological-oceanic variables may be useful for long-term forecasting and climate modelling. By using long time series this paper attempts to identify large-scale quasi-cycles in the precipitation regimes of Northern Argentina, moisture advection from the Atlantic Ocean and the streamflow of the Paraná River. This work also shows the presence of coherent waves with long periodicity between the three series. As the three variables are estimated over different time intervals, the presence of waves in each variable is studied separately, to show they respond to the same process. The three variables show significant interdecadal variability at low frequency (22-26 years), which might be related to the ENSO cycle modulation and to the intensification or weakening of the South American Low Level Jet (SALLJ) and South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ).

AB  - The Network Tracing Method (NTM) has been developed to determine gridded coarse river networks for modeling large hydrologic systems. For a coarse resolution grid, the NTM determines the downstream cell of each cell and the distance along the actual meandering flow paths between them. Unlike previously developed methods, the NTM uses fine resolution vector river networks as the source of information of the flow patterns rather than digital elevation models. The main advantage of using vector river networks as input is that they capture the hydrologic terrain features better than topographic data do, particularly in areas of low topographic relief. The NTM was applied to South America with a grid resolution of 1 degree by 1 degree and to the globe with a resolution of 2.815 degrees by 2.8125 degrees. Overall, the method captured the flow patterns well. Generated digital river networks and drainage divides showed minor disagreement with those obtained from existing maps, and most of them were consistent with the resolution of the coarse river network. The majority of estimated basin areas were also close to documented values. River lengths calculated with the NTM, however, were consistently underpredicted.

AB  - In mountain environments, spatial and temporal patterns of snow accumulation and melt are dominant controls on hydrologic responses to climate change. In this paper, we develop a simple conceptual model that links the timing of peak snowmelt with geologically mediated differences in rate of streamflow recession. This model demonstrates that within the western United States, spatial differences in subsurface drainage rates can exacerbate summer streamflow losses associated with diminishing snowpacks. Application of a process-based hydrologic model to four watersheds in the Western Cordillera further reveals that contingent on timing of snowmelt, slower draining watersheds are likely to have more water in summer but paradoxically are subject to the greatest summer water losses under a 1.5°C warming scenario. A slow draining watershed located in the young volcanic arc of the High Cascades in Oregon shows 4 times the summer streamflow reduction when compared with faster draining watersheds with similar timing of peak snowmelt. On the other hand, watersheds where snowmelt occurs late in the season but have little groundwater influence show high relative sensitivities to snowpack changes due to warming, as shown by a high-elevation granitic Sierran watershed. Our results highlight the importance of geological factors in interpreting hydrologic response to climate change and argue for a geoclimatic framework to guide the design of monitoring networks that will become the basis for assessing climate change.

AB  - In this study, new estimates of monthly freshwater discharge from continents, drainage regions, and global land for the period of 2003-05 are presented. The method uses observed terrestrial water storage change estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and reanalysis-based atmospheric moisture divergence and precipitable water tendency in a coupled land-atmosphere water mass balance. The estimates of freshwater discharge are analyzed within the context of global climate and compared with previously published estimates. Annual cycles of observed streamflow exhibit stronger correlations with the computed discharge compared to those with precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P - E) in several of the world's largest river basins. The estimate presented herein of the mean monthly discharge from South America (∼846 km3 month-1) is the highest among the continents and that flowing into the Atlantic Ocean (∼1382 km3 month-1) is the highest among the drainage regions. The volume of global freshwater discharge estimated here is 30 354 ± 1212 km3 yr-1. Monthly variations of global freshwater discharge peak between August and September and reach a minimum in February. Global freshwater discharge is also computed using a global ocean-atmosphere mass balance in order to validate the land-atmosphere water balance estimates and as a measure of global water budget closure. Results show close proximity between the two estimates of global discharge at monthly (RMSE = 329 km3 month-1) and annual time scales (358 km3 yr-1). Results and comparisons to observations indicate that the method shows important potential for global-scale monitoring of combined surface water and submarine groundwater discharge at near-real time, as well as for contributing to contemporary global water balance studies and for constraining global hydrologic model simulations. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Global and regional climate models (GCM and RCM respectively) are the current mathematical tools used to project alterations on precipitation regimes given different greenhouse gases emissions scenarios. However, these models have specific resolutions, physical equations and numerical approaches that provide a diverse set of performances across different regions and spatial–temporal scales. In South America, most hydrological impact studies have used the Eta RCM to yield precipitation projections without a proper uncertainty analysis. It is important to acknowledge its uncertainties prior to any hydrological assessment to adequately support climate change investigations and related water decision making. Therefore, we aim to investigate how Eta extreme precipitation biases vary in different spatial–temporal scales from a hydrological perspective. Thus, we evaluate the extreme precipitation generated by the Eta RCM driven by four different GCMs. It is investigated Eta biases across different temporal (3 hr–5 days) and spatial scales (0.2–1.0°) and how those errors affect river streamflow simulations. It is used local intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves and gridded precipitation datasets (MSWEP and ERA5-Land) as references for Eta assessment. In general, Eta underestimates subdaily extreme precipitation across South America, regardless of the driven GCM. The median bias of a 10-year return period daily precipitation is −36 mm (1st and 3rd quantiles −58 and −17 mm) compared to MSWEP and −26 mm (1st and 3rd quantiles −45 and −11 mm) compared to ERA5-Land. However, the relative errors reduce with temporal and spatial aggregation. For example, the average bias of extreme precipitation decreases 8.4 and 5.4 percentage points from 1- to 5-day duration compared to MSWEP and ERA5-Land, respectively. The negative biases observed for precipitation ((Formula presented.) 20%) are propagated to the flood discharges ((Formula presented.) 40%), and these errors reduce with the drainage area. In general, there are greater biases in extreme discharges for small basins, but these errors considerably reduce for basins larger than 30,000 km2 compared to MGB-MSWEP simulations. Compared to MGB-ERA5-Land simulations, MGB-Eta presents relatively similar errors for basins of different sizes, probably due to the high negative bias for not only extreme but average precipitation as well. © 2022 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB  - Future increase of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in tropical regions is expected to have negative impacts on forests ecosystems and related biogeochemical processes. In tropical mountain forests topography causes complex streamflow and rainfall patterns, governing the atmospheric transport of pollutants and the intensity and spatial variability of deposition. The main goal of the current study is to link spatio-temporal patterns of upwind nitrogen emissions and nitrate deposition in the San Francisco Valley (eastern Andes of southern Ecuador) at different altitudinal levels. The work is based on Scanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) retrieved-NO2 concentrations, NOx biomass burning emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv3), and regional vehicle emissions inventory (SA-INV) inventory for urban emissions in South America. The emission data is used as input for lagrangian atmospheric backward trajectory modeling (FLEXTRA) backward trajectory modeling to model the transport to the study area. The results show that NO3- concentrations in occult precipitation samples are significantly correlated to long-range atmospheric secondary nitrogen transport at the highest meteorological stations (MSs) only, whereas for NO3- concentrations in rain samples this correlation is more pronounced at the lower MSs. We conclude that ion concentrations in occult precipitation at the uppermost MSs are mainly linked to distant emission sources via the synoptic circulation impinging the more exposed higher sites. Lower correlations close to the valley bottom are due to a lower occult precipitation frequency and point to a contamination of the samples by local pollution sources not captured by the used emission data sources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent scientific and computational developments have pushed hydrological forecasting systems up to continental and global scales. In this study, we evaluate the potential skill of ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America (SA), with a closer look on some of the large basins of the continent. Medium-range precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System were used to force a continental-scale, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to produce streamflow forecasts up to 15 days in advance. Forecasts were evaluated over a 4-year period against a reference simulation, derived from the hydrological model forced with a gridded precipitation dataset that merges data from multiple sources (MSWEP). To provide a benchmark for assessing the potential skill, forecasts based on the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique were produced by running the hydrological model with precipitation data resampled from past MSWEP observations. Overall, ECMWF-based forecasts were skillful mainly at the eastern and southeastern regions of the continent (e.g., São Francisco, Parnaíba, Upper Paraná, Tocantins-Araguaia and Uruguay basins), showing little or no added skill in large rivers draining the Andes such as the Magdalena, Orinoco, Madeira (Amazon) and right-bank tributaries of the Paraguay. In the latter basins, ECMWF-based forecasts largely overestimated the exceedance probabilities of critical thresholds due to a positive bias in the predicted precipitation (in relation to MSWEP), visible mostly during the wet season. In addition, forecasts were found to perform better than ESP in terms of both overall quality and discrimination skill at regions characterized by a warm temperate, fully-humid climate. A direct relation between forecast skill and basin size was not always valid, since the former can vary geographically along tributaries. Limitations and future developments needed for continental-scale hydrological forecasting in SA are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Iberá Wetlands are one of the largest inland freshwater ecosystems in the world hosting several unique flora and fauna species. They are located in northeastern Argentina, a region in southeastern South America that experienced large positive precipitation trends during the last decades. The aim of this paper is to calibrate and evaluate a hydrological model on the Iberá basin in order to quantify the hydrologic impacts of potential regional temperature and precipitation variations in the context of climate change as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. For this purpose, a version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model, accounting for the presence of lakes and Wetlands, was applied for the first time to the Iberá basin. Results show that the model can successfully simulate the main features of the system dynamics, including the daily mean streamflow of the Corriente River, the daily level of the Iberá Lake and the daily lake evaporation. Inclusion of the lake and Wetlands module improved the streamflow simulations. Sensitivity tests of the Iberá basin hydrology were performed by varying regional temperature and rainfall conditions according to the outputs of a set of climate models for three different time slices during the 21st century. These tests showed a strong dependence of the basin hydrology on the precipitation changes rather on the temperature ones. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Study region: South America large basins (>5000 km²) Study focus: This work represents a first assessment of seasonal streamflow forecasts in South America based on a continental-scale application of a large scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model and ECMWF's seasonal forecasting system precipitation forecasts (SEAS5-SSF) with bias correction. Seasonal streamflow forecasts were evaluated against a reference model run. Forecast skill was estimated relative to the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) method. New hydrological insights: We observed that bias correction was essential to obtain positive skill of SEAS5-SSF over ESP, which remained a hard to beat benchmark, especially in regions with high seasonality, and highly dependent on initial conditions. SEAS5-SSF skill was found to be dependent on initialization month, basin and lead time. Rivers where the skill is higher were Amazon, Araguaia, Tocantins and Paraná. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Following large explosive volcanic eruptions, precipitation decreases over much of the globe, particularly in climatologically wet regions. Stratospheric volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight, which reduces evaporation, whilst surface cooling stabilizes the atmosphere and reduces its water-holding capacity. Circulation changes modulate this global precipitation reduction on regional scales. Despite the importance of rivers to people, it has been unclear whether volcanism causes detectable changes in streamflow, given large natural variability. Here we analyse observational records of streamflow volume for fifty large rivers from around the world that cover between two and six major volcanic eruptions in the twentieth and late nineteenth century. We find statistically significant reductions in flow following eruptions for the Amazon, Congo, Nile, Orange, Ob, Yenisey and Kolyma, amongst others. When data from neighbouring rivers are combined - based on the areas where climate models simulate either an increase or a decrease in precipitation following eruptions - a significant (p < 0.1) decrease in streamflow following eruptions is detected in northern South American, central African and high-latitude Asian rivers, and on average across wet tropical and subtropical regions. We also detect a significant increase in flow in southern South American and southwestern North American rivers. Our findings suggest that future volcanic eruptions could substantially affect global water availability. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Water availability is one of the main limitations for future development and economic activity in many regions of the world. This applies even to areas of relatively high annual rainfall, such as the Valdivian Rainforest eco-region in Chile (35-48°S). Streamflow and water availability are crucial for several economic activities in the eco-region including hydroelectricity, irrigation, salmon farming, sports fishing of introduced trout and tourism. Scientific research focused on the spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow is a key element for planning the future development within the eco-region. In this paper we explore the potential of tree-rings for streamflow reconstruction in this region. Our preliminary results indicate a significant correlation (r=0.59 P<0.001, 1929-2000) between prior summer Río Bueno streamflow (January-April) and the average between a composite tree-ring chronology using Pilgerodendron uviferum from Chile and two composite Austrocedrus chilensis chronologies from Argentinean Patagonia. Similarly, there is a significant correlation (r=0.57, P<0.001, 1943-2002), between the Austrocedrus chronology (40°44′S) at Centinela in Argentinean Patagonia and the previous spring through early autumn (November-April) streamflow for Río Puelo. The tree-ring records used to correlate with Río Bueno and Río Puelo discharges show low-frequency variability and therefore the potential to reconstruct this variability in streamflow for the last 500-780 years. We also found a significant correlation between the composite Pilgerodendron standard ring-width chronology and the current summer water salinity (January-April) at the Reloncavi Estuary (r2=0.60, P<0.01, 1992-2000). Water salinity is a crucial determinant of the carrying capacity of salmon farming. Future research should provide reconstructions of streamflow, water salinity and other water quality attributes from tree-rings. These data will provide inputs to modeling scenarios of future water availability and are crucial to decision-making and planning of resource management and socio-economic development in the Valdivian Rainforest eco-region. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The devastating effects of floods, combined with scarce data sets, have stimulated the development of hydrological regionalisation techniques. The present study proposed an evaluation of the L-moments based index-flood procedure, coupled with watershed grouping based on geographical convenience for regionalisation of maximum streamflows. A pioneer analysis for South America, addressing the geographical classification method adopted by National Water Agency of Brazil (ANA), was conducted considering over 100 watersheds in southern Brazil. Nonstationary and discordant maximum annual streamflow (MAS) series were removed with the aid of the Mann–Kendall test and discordancy measure, whereas the heterogeneity measure was used to check regional homogeneity. The best regional distribution was identified by the ZDIST goodness-of-fit measure. Finally, multiple nonlinear regressions, considering morphological and meteorological watershed characteristics, were performed to obtain better index-flood estimates. It was concluded that: (a) the proposed methodological strategy provided satisfactory estimation of design floods; (b) area, mean slope, stream gradient, and flow length, were the most satisfactory explanatory variables; (c) the fitted equations stand out as a state-of-art alternative for the scarce hydrological monitoring in southern Brazil; and (d) the hydrological boundaries defined by ANA might not be the most adequate approach from a regional point of view. © 2018 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In this work, the role of initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) in the predictability of natural flows of large river basins (>1000 km2) in South America using the South American Large Basins Model (MGB-SA) was investigated. We proposed an analysis based on a simple metric: predictability was estimated by the number of days in which the streamflow forecasts performed above a given threshold. The role of ICs was assessed through null precipitation experiments and the role of BCs through climatological rainfall. For experiments with a Kling-Gupta efficiency metric and threshold of 0.95, the study shows that streamflow predictability from the ICs is relatively high (up to 40 days) in the main river reaches of flat-relief basins. The increase in predictability due to climatology-based BCs mostly occurs in areas with high predictability based on ICs. Basins with fast response present low streamflow predictability (up to three days). © 2022 IAHS.

AB  - Tropical savannas are one of the most affected biomes worldwide by anthropogenic activities. The Cerrado biome, also referred to as the Brazilian Tropical Savanna, is one of the world's environmental hotspots due to its high biodiversity and endemism. Also, it is essential for water resources in South America and hydropower generation in Brazil. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate possible changes in water availability in the Cerrado due to the impacts of climate change throughout the 21st century under different emissions scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated and validated in a watershed encompassing 51 237 km2. The regional climate models (RCMs) Eta-HadGEM-ES and Eta-MIROC5 under the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 were used to simulate the streamflow changes in three time slices (2010–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2099). The streamflow can be reduced by up to 70%, being Eta/HadGEM2-ES RCM under RCP 8.5 projected the most severe impact. On average, the most significant runoff reductions occurred in the first and third time slice (−54.51%). Baseflow and evapotranspiration can reduce up to 55% and 23%, respectively, at the end of the century. In addition, the hydrological drought assessment stressed the higher frequency of severe drought events in the first time slice. Streamflow regularization can be an alternative to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the Brazilian Tropical Savanna throughout the 21st century. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - How drought may change in the future are of great concern as global warming continues. In Part I of this study, we examine the uncertainties in estimating recent drought changes. Substantial uncertainties arise in the calculated Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) with Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiraiton (PDSI_pm) due to different choices of forcing data (especially for precipitation, solar radiation and wind speed) and the calibration period. After detailed analyses, we recommend using the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) or the Global Precipitation Climatology (GPCP) datasets over other existing land precipitation products due to poor data coverage in the other datasets since the 1990s. We also recommend not to include the years after 1980 in the PDSI calibration period to avoid including the anthropogenic climate change as part of the natural variability used for calibration. Consistent with reported declines in pan evaporation, our calculated potential evapotranspiration (PET) shows negative or small trends since 1950 over the United States, China, and other regions, and no global PET trends from 1950 to 1990. Updated precipitation and streamflow data and the self-calibrated PDSI_pm all show consistent drying during 1950–2012 over most Africa, East and South Asia, southern Europe, eastern Australia, and many parts of the Americas. While these regional drying trends resulted primarily from precipitation changes related to multi-decadal oscillations in Pacific sea surface temperatures, rapid surface warming and associated increases in surface vapor pressure deficit since the 1980s have become an increasingly important cause of widespread drying over land. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Study region: The study was developed for fhe Pomba River Basin, which is located in southeast region of Brazil in the continent of South America. Study focus: This study aimed to (a) calibrate and validate the SWAT model for a sub-basin of Pomba River Basin, (b) validate it for use with upstream and downstream control sections and (c) validate it for sub-basins other than the one where calibration was performed. This was done with the goal of having a model that can be used for the estimation of water availability and the planning of soil use and occupation. The model was calibrated by trial and error during the period from January 1996 through December 1999, while validation was conducted during the period from January 2000 through December 2004. Estimated the maximum, average and minimum annual daily streamflows were evaluated based on the paired t-test and linear regression analysis. New hydrological insights: The SWAT model was qualified for simulating the Pomba River sub-basin in the sites where rainfall representation was reasonable to good. The model can be used in the simulation of maximum, average and minimum annual daily streamflow based on the paired t-test, contributing with the water resources management of region, although the model still needs to be improved, mainly in the representativeness of rainfall, to give better estimates of extreme values. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change, drought and the world's growing population are increasing the demand for water which in turn requires improved water resources management. The sustainable management of a watershed requires a thorough knowledge of its water resources, including monthly streamflow. Spain is home to a large number of ungauged watersheds, the streamflows of which are often unknown. Chavez et al. (2007) reported a model for predicting monthly streamflow in ungauged watersheds that was validated for use in areas of tropical climate in Central America and a dry area in South America. This work reports an attempt to assess the performance of this model for eventual use with ungauged watersheds in Spain, using data for a number of watersheds for which gauging data were available. The proposed model took into account physical characteristics such us the soil infiltration rate, the slope of the terrain, plant fractional cover, the monthly moisture adequacy index, and the leaf area index. Comparisons of model-predicted monthly streamflows and those actually measured showed the Chavez et al. model unable to make reliable predictions for Spanish watersheds in its current form. A new approach has been developed considering only smaller watersheds in Spanish conditions, changing parameters in the original model. These parameters have been calibrated and validated, reaching adequate adjustment of results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A novel approach for estimating precipitation patterns is developed here and applied to generate a new hydrologically corrected daily precipitation dataset, called RAIN4PE (Rain for Peru and Ecuador), at 0.18 spatial resolution for the period 1981–2015 covering Peru and Ecuador. It is based on the application of 1) the random forest method to merge multisource precipitation estimates (gauge, satellite, and reanalysis) with terrain elevation, and 2) observed and modeled streamflow data to first detect biases and second further adjust gridded precipitation by inversely applying the simulated results of the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). Hydrological results using RAIN4PE as input for the Peruvian and Ecuadorian catchments were compared against the ones when feeding other uncorrected (CHIRP and ERA5) and gaugecorrected (CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PISCO) precipitation datasets into the model. For that, SWAT was calibrated and validated at 72 river sections for each dataset using a range of performance metrics, including hydrograph goodness of fit andflow duration curve signatures. Results showed that gauge-corrected precipitation datasets outperformed uncorrected ones for streamflow simulation. However, CHIRPS, MSWEP, and PISCO showed limitations for streamflow simulation in several catchments draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Amazon River. RAIN4PE provided the best overall performance for streamflow simulation, including flow variability (low, high, and peak flows) and water budget closure. The overall good performance of RAIN4PE as input for hydrological modeling provides a valuable criterion of its applicability for robust countrywide hydrometeorological applications, including hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Hydrological studies in the La Plata basin are important as it is a source capable of providing water to several countries in South America, a large navigable network and rich in mineral resources. However, the necessity of these studies is highlighted by the frequent floods that occur in it. In this work, it is proposed to employ the statistical modelling through the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models, with the aim to represent and forecast the time series for monthly streamflow in different stations in the La Plata Basin. Proper models were proposed for the monthly streamflow time series in Timbúes station (Paraná River) for five subtemporal periods of twenty years from 1913 to 2012. Moreover, for Corrientes, Timbúes and Paso de los Libres stations, a forecast for 32 months (January/2013-August/2015) was carried out taking into consideration the last subperiod, 1993-2012. The validation of the models was considered. Finally, forecast with different future scenarios were done in Corrientes station, and a comparison with the gauged values was included. In this way, it was pretended to find a statistical models in order to contribute to the monitoring of the monthly discharge in the La Plata Basin with the objective to mitigate negative impacts in the region. © 2015 Revista Meteorológica.

AB  - Natural river flow provides the conditions required to sustain freshwater ecosystems, and the greater the departure from the natural regime, the greater the loss of those ecosystems. In South America, new hydropower dams are continuously being constructed and planned in regions within and around the Amazon basin and in the Upper Paraguay river basin, a region notable for the Pantanal, a huge wetland ecosystem that is largely dependent on the flow regime of the Paraguay river and its tributaries. In this context, it is meaningful to examine the hydrological changes caused by the major Manso dam, that is operating since 2001 at the headwaters of one of the major tributaries of the Paraguay river. This was done for the same case study by other authors in previous studies using only gauging stations data. However, those previous assessments were limited due to the confounding effects of climate variability and the necessity of relatively long term observed time series. Here, we applied a modeling approach to evaluate the changes in hydrological regime caused by Manso dam operation. Our modeling approach was based on the combination of the MGB large-scale hydrologic model with the SIRIPLAN large-scale wetland model. The models were applied, using river reaches from 2 to 10 km, in two scenarios during the period from 2003 to 2015. In the first scenario we used naturalized streamflow at the dam site as input to the hydrological model. In the second scenario we used observed reservoir outflow time series as input to the hydrological model. Our results show that Manso dam has a regulation effect that decreases high flows, increases low flows and reduces lateral connectivity. The decrease in high flows is more pronounced in the region upstream of the Pantanal floodplain, but not limited to, while increase in low flows extends into Pantanal. Timing of maximum and minimum flows is less affected, except for the river reach immediately downstream of the dam. Our results improve the assessment of spatial patterns of hydrologic alteration, giving more confidence in the assessment of magnitude and spatial extension of the effects of Manso dam in the Pantanal region. © Copyright © 2020 Jardim, Melo, Ribeiro, Collischonn and Paz.

AB  - The subject of this study is to analyse the hydroclimatic variability in three large river basins in South America: the Amazon, the São Francisco in Northeast Brazil and the Paraná-La Plata in subtropical southeastern South America. This study is based on long-term observations of river streamflow and rainfall in these river basins, as well as estimates of the water balance components. The focus is to identify interannual and decadal time-scale variability, as well as to investigate the variability of the atmospheric moisture transports in and out of the river basins typical of the present climate. Together with the observational analysis we use a 50-year simulation of decadal-scale variability from the Centro de Previsão de Tempo e Estudos Climaticos atmospheric global climate model (CPTEC AGCM). After identifying decadal time-scale variability, we link this variability to the observed variability on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and also identify these modes of variability in the CPTEC AGCM simulations. climate variability; semiarid regions; tropical climates; water balance.

AB  - The potential utility of the real-time Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis real-time product 3B42RT (TMPA-RT) data for streamflow prediction, both through direct comparisons of TMPA-RT estimates with a gridded gauge product and through evaluation of streamflow simulations over four tributaries of La Plata basin (LPB) in South America using the two precipitation products, is investigated. Assessments indicate that the relative accuracy and the hydrologic performance of TMPA-RT-based streamflow simulations generally improved after February 2005. The improvements in TMPA-RT since 2005 are closely related to upgrades in the TMPA-RT algorithm in early February 2005, which include use of additional microwave sensors [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)] and implementation of different calibration schemes. This study suggests considerable potential for hydrologic prediction using purely satellite-derived precipitation estimates (no adjustments by in situ gauges) in parts of the globe where in situ observations are sparse. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Hydrologic modeling can be used to aid in decision-making at the local scale. Developed countries usually have their own hydrologic models; however, developing countries often have limited hydrologic modeling capabilities due to factors such as the maintenance, computational costs, and technical capacity needed to run models. A global streamflow prediction system (GSPS) would help decrease vulnerabilities in developing countries and fill gaps in areas where no local models exist by providing extensive results that can be filtered for specific locations. However, large-scale forecasting systems come with their own challenges. These New hydroinformatic challenges can prevent these models from reaching their full potential of becoming useful in the decision making process. This article discusses these challenges along with the background leading to the development of a large-scale streamflow prediction system. In addition, we present a large-scale streamflow prediction system developed using the GloFAS-RAPID model. The developed model covers Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia. The results from this model are made available using a Hydrologic Modeling as a Service approach (HMaaS) as an answer to some of the discussed challenges. In contrast to the traditional modeling approach, which makes results available only to those with the resources necessary to run hydrologic models, the HMaaS approach makes results available using web services that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Web applications and services for providing improved data accessibility, and addressing the discussed hydroinformamtic challenges are also presented. The HydroViewer app, a custom application to display model results and facilitate data consumption and integration at the local level is presented. We also conducted validation tests to ensure that model results are acceptable. Some of the countries where the presented services and applications have been tested include Argentina, Bangladesh, Colombia, Peru, Nepal, and the Dominican Republic. Overall, a HMaaS approach to operationalize a GSPS and provide meaningful and easily accessible results at the local level is provided with the potential to allow decision makers to focus on solving some of the most pressing water-related issues we face as a society. © Copyright © 2019 Souffront Alcantara, Nelson, Shakya, Edwards, Roberts, Krewson, Ames, Jones and Gutierrez.

AB  - The mechanisms that underlie the diversification of Neotropical primates remain contested. One mechanism that has found support is the riverine barrier hypothesis (RBH), which postulates that large rivers impede gene flow between populations on opposite riverbanks and promote allopatric speciation. Ayres and Clutton-Brock (1992) demonstrated that larger Amazonian rivers acted as barriers, delineating the distribution limits of primate species. However, profound changes in taxonomy and species concepts have led to the proliferation of Neotropical primate taxa, which may have reduced support for their results. Using the most recent taxonomic assessments and distribution maps, we tested the effect of increasing river size on the similarity of opposite riverbank primate communities in the Amazon. First, we conducted a literature review of primate taxonomy and developed a comprehensive spatial database, then applied geographical information system to query mapped primate ranges against the riverine geography of the Amazon watershed to produce a similarity index for opposite riverbank communities. Finally, we ran models to test how measures of river size predicted levels of similarity. We found that, almost without exception, similarity scores were lower than scores from Ayres and Clutton-Brock (1992) for the same rivers. Our model showed a significant negative relationship between streamflow and similarity in all tests, and found river width significant for the segmented Amazon, but not for multiple Amazon watershed rivers. Our results support the RBH insofar as they provide evidence for the prediction that rivers with higher streamflow act as more substantial barriers to dispersal, and accordingly exhibit greater variation in community composition between riverbanks. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Interannual variations of the summertime (January-March) atmospheric circulation over subtropical South America are examined during the period 1958-97 using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data. It is found from and empirical orthogonal function analysis that an anomalous upper-tropospheric large-scale stationary eddy in the lee of the Andes tends to accompany a dipole in anomalous vertical motion. An anomalous cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy accompanies an intensified (diffuse) South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ), with anomalous descent (ascent) to the southwest. The cold-core equivalent barotropic vertical structure of the anomalous cyclonic cyclonic eddy and the 200-hpa vorticity balance are both characterictic of a stationary Rossby wave; the tendency for the eddy to be advected downstream by the mean westerlies is compensated by meridional advection of planetary vorticity and stretching associated with vertical motion. The anomalous cyclonic flow at low levels reinforces the thermally direct circulation associated with the SACZ. A weak funneling of submonthly Rossby wave activity into this descent region is also identified. The interannual time series of the eddy is significantly correlated with north-south dipolar sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the southwest Atlantic; one standard deviation 200-hpa wind speed anomalies of up to 5 m s-1 are accompanied by SST anomalies of up to 0.3°C. A near-cyclic 15-yr component is identified, which the authors corroborate from indepindent analyses of southwest Atlantic SSTs and river flows; both are found to exhibit very similar oscillatory components. When the SACZ is intensified, the Paraná and Paraguay rivers in southern Brazil tend to swell, while the Uruguay and Negro rivers to the south tend to ebb; this north-south contrast in streamflow anomalies is most marked on the interdecadal timescale.

AB  - We present an assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrologic regime of the 600,000 km2 Upper Paraguay River basin, located in central South America based on predictions of 20 Atmospheric/Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). We considered two climate change scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and two 30-years time intervals centered at 2030 and 2070. Projected temperature and precipitation anomalies estimated by the AOGCMs for the study site are spatially downscaled. Time series of projected temperature and precipitation were estimated using the delta change approach. These time series were used as input to a detailed coupled hydrologic-hydraulic model aiming to estimate projected streamflow in climate change scenarios at several control points in the basin. Results show that impacts on streamflow are highly dependent on the AOGCM used to obtain the climate predictions. Patterns of temperature increase persist over the entire year for almost all AOGCMs resulting in an increase in the evapotranspiration rate of the hydrological model. The precipitation anomalies show large dispersion, being projected as either an increase or decrease in precipitation rates. Based on these inputs, results from the coupled hydrologic-hydraulic model show nearly one half of projections as increasing river discharge, and other half as decreasing river discharge. If the mean or median of the predictions is considered, no discernible change in river discharge should be expected, despite the dispersion among results of the AOGCMs that reached +/−10 % in the short horizon and +/− 20 % in the long horizon, at several control points. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The synoptic mode of variability (SMV) refers to changes in atmospheric conditions over periods ranging from 2 to 10 days. In tropical regions, this variability is driven by tropical waves that have a clear signal on the wavenumber–frequency power spectra of precipitation. This study uses the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method to identify the SMV in daily precipitation and streamflows in 47 river basins over northern South America. We found the presence of the frequency bands with periods of 3–12 days and 6–18 days, which agrees with the SMV associated with tropical waves that modulate precipitation over the region. Furthermore, our results reveal that variance explained by the SMV in rainfall over each catchment is greater than the variance explained by those SMV in streamflows, which suggests that catchments efficiently filter out this variability. We found that SMV explains from 5% to 20% of streamflow variability for catchments ranging from 1000 km2 to 5000 km2. Additionally, the variance explained by SMV decreases as a power fit with the catchment area. Thus, this study characterizes the SMV for potential applications on regional hydrology, diagnosis, modeling, short-time forecasting, prediction, and management of water resources. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Satellite-based precipitation estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution and large areal coverage provide a potential alternative source of forcing data for hydrological models in regions where conventional in situ precipitation measurements are not readily available. The La Plata basin in South America provides a good example of a case where the use of satellite-derived precipitation could be beneficial. This study evaluates basinwide precipitation estimates from 9 yr (1998-2006) of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA; 3B42 V.6) through comparison with available gauged data and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) semidistributed hydrology model applied to the La Plata basin. In general, the TMPA estimates agreed well with the gridded gauge data at monthly time scales, most likely because of the monthly adjustment to gauges performed in TMPA. The agreement between TMPA and gauge precipitation estimates was reduced at daily time scales, particularly for high rain rates. The TMPA-driven hydrologic model simulations were able to capture the daily flooding events and to represent low flows, although peak flows tended to be biased upward. There was a good agreement between TMPA-driven simulated flows in terms of their reproduction of seasonal and interannual streamflow variability. This analysis shows that TMPA has potential for hydrologic forecasting in data-sparse regions. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important driver of interannual climate variability with increasing attention for its impacts on water and flood management. The impact of ENSO on basin-scale floods during the TRMM period (1998–2013) is examined by using the streamflow outputs from the Dominant river Routing Integrated with VIC Environment model (DRIVE). Significant simultaneous correlations between flood indices and Niño 3.4 appear in many flood-prone river basins during peak flood months across both the tropics and midlatitudes especially for flood frequency and flood duration. Gauged by significant lag-correlations between floods and Niño 3.4, significant ENSO-leading-floods relations are found as well in many river basins in South America, south and southeastern Asia, and northern Africa. These ENSO-floods-relations can greatly enhance understanding of physical mechanisms relevant to the ENSO impact and may also improve the skills of basin-scale monthly-to-seasonal flood forecast, thus allowing for better preparedness and management of flood risks. ©2020.

AB  - In humid tropical systems, the large intraseasonal and interannual variability of rainfall can significantly affect all components of the water balance. This variability and the lack of detailed hydrological and meteorological data in both temporal and spatial scales have created uncertainties regarding the closure of the water balance for the Amazon basin. Previous studies in Amazonian micro-catchments suggested that both the unsaturated and groundwater system, which are not taken into consideration in basin-wide water budgets published in the literature, play an important role in controlling the timing of runoff generation. In this paper, the components of the water balance and the variations in different storages within the system were examined using 3 years' data from a 6.58 km2 micro-catchment in central Amazonia. The role and relative importance of the various stores were examined. The results show a strong memory effect in the groundwater system that carries over seasonal climate anomalies from one year to the next and affects the hydrological response well beyond the time span of the anomaly. In addition, the deep unsaturated zone was found to play a key role in reducing most of the intraseasonal variability and also affected the groundwater recharge. This memory effect is crucial for sustaining streamflow and evaporation in years with rainfall deficiency. The memory effect caused by storage in the groundwater and unsaturated systems may also prevent the closure of annual large-scale water balances, which assume that storage returns to a standard state each year.

AB  - The performance of a simple, spatially-lumped, rainfall-streamflow model is compared with that of a more complex, spatially-distributed model. In terms of two model-fit statistics it is shown that for two catchments in Brazil (about 30,000 km2 and 34,000 km2) with different flow regimes, the simpler catchment models, which are unit hydrograph-based and require only rainfall, streamflow and air temperature data for calibration, perform about as well as more complex catchment models that require additional information from satellite images and digitized maps of elevation, land-use and soils. Simple catchment models are applied in forecasting mode, using daily rainfall forecasts from a regional weather forecasting model. The value of the rainfall forecasts, relative to the case where rainfall is known, is assessed for both catchments. The results are discussed in the context of on-going work to compare different modelling approaches for many other Brazilian catchments, and to apply improved forecasting algorithms based on the simple modelling approach to the same, and other, catchments. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Historically, flood risk management and flood frequency modeling have been based on assumption of stationarity, i.e., flood probabilities are invariant across years. However, it is now recognized that in many places, extreme floods are associated with specific climate states which may recur with non-uniform probability across years. Conditional on knowledge of the operating climate regime, the probability of a flood of a certain magnitude can be higher or lower in a given year. Here we explore nonstationary flood risk for the streamflow series of the Negro River at the city of Manaus in Brazil by investigating climate teleconnections associated with the interannual variability of the peak flows. We evaluate attributes and the fit of a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with nonstationary parameters to the annual peak series of the Negro River stages. The annual peak flood occurs between May and July and its magnitude depends on the Negro River stage at the beginning of the year and on the previous December sea surface temperature (SST) of a region in the tropical Pacific Ocean. A statistically significant monotonic trend is also observed in the peak level series. The indexing of the parameters of a GEV distribution to the NINO3 index and to the observed river stage at the beginning of the year reveals a changing flood hazard for the city, with the joint occurrence of high values associated with La Niña conditions in the previous December and high river stages in January preceding the flood season. The proposed model is shown to be useful for quantifying the changing flood hazard several months in advance for Manaus, thus providing an early flood alert system for the city and may be an important tool for the dynamic flood risk management for the region. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model consists of a stochastic hourly precipitation point process model and a conceptual model that transforms precipitation into flow. It was applied to the Santa Cruz River at the border crossing from Mexico into Southern Arizona. The model was constructed for four different seasons and three categories of inter-annual variability for the wet seasons of summer and winter. The drainage area is ungauged and precipitation information was inferred from a precipitation gauge downstream. The precipitation gauge record was evaluated against simulated precipitation from a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, and was found to be the representative of the regional precipitation variability. The flow generation was found to reproduce the variability in the observed record at the daily, seasonal and annual time scales, and it is suitable for use in planning studies for the study site. © 2007 Hydrologic Research Center.

AB  - Providing reliable estimates of streamflow and hydrological fluxes is a major challenge for water resources management over national and transnational basins in South America. Global hydrological models and land surface models are a possible solution to simulate the terrestrial water cycle at the continental scale, but issues about parameterization and limitations in representing lowland river systems can place constraints on these models to meet local needs. In an attempt to overcome such limitations, we extended a regional, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (MGB; <i>Modelo hidrológico de Grandes Bacias</i>) to the continental domain of South America and assessed its performance using daily river discharge, water levels from independent sources (in situ, satellite altimetry), estimates of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and evapotranspiration (ET) from remote sensing and other available global datasets. In addition, river discharge was compared with outputs from global models acquired through the eartH2Observe project (HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood, LISFLOOD and WaterGAP3), providing the first cross-scale assessment (regional/continental&thinsp; × &thinsp;global models) that makes use of spatially distributed, daily discharge data. A satisfactory representation of discharge and water levels was obtained (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE&thinsp;&gt;&thinsp;0.6 in 55&thinsp;% of the cases) and the continental model was able to capture patterns of seasonality and magnitude of TWS and ET, especially over the largest basins of South America. After the comparison with global models, we found that it is possible to obtain considerable improvement on daily river discharge, even by using current global forcing data, just by combining parameterization and better routing physics based on regional experience. Issues about the potential sources of errors related to both global- and continental-scale modeling are discussed, as well as future directions for improving large-scale model applications in this continent. We hope that our study provides important insights to reduce the gap between global and regional hydrological modeling communities.</p>. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Probabilistic hydrological forecasting and ensemble techniques have leveraged streamflow prediction at regional to continental scales up to several weeks in advance. However, ensembles that only account for meteorological forecast uncertainty are typically biased and subject to dispersion errors, thus limiting their use for rational decision-making and optimization systems. Statistical postprocessing is therefore necessary to convert ensemble forecasts into calibrated and sharp predictive distributions, and it should also account for dependencies between lead times to enable realistic forecast trajectories. This work provides a continental-scale assessment of the use of statistical postprocessing on medium-range, ensemble streamflow forecasts over South America (SA). These forecasts were produced through a large-scale hydrologic–hydrodynamic model forced with a global precipitation dataset and ECMWF reforecast data. The Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) technique was used to generate conditional predictive distributions in 488 locations at each forecast lead time, while the Ensemble Copula Coupling method with the transformation scheme (ECC-T) was applied to derive ensemble traces from EMOS distributions. Postprocessed streamflow forecasts were cross-validated for the period from 1996 to 2014 using a range of verification metrics. Results showed that the skill and reliability of EMOS forecasts substantially improve over the raw ensembles, and that EMOS leads to skillful predictions relative to discharge climatology and persistence forecasts up to 15 days in advance in most locations. Furthermore, EMOS results in predictive distributions that are generally sharper than the climatology. Limitations in depicting autocorrelations of forecast trajectories were observed in rivers for which the raw ensemble spread is very low and EMOS has to largely increase dispersion, especially at short lead times. The study's findings suggest that combining a continental-scale hydrological model with EMOS and ECC-T methods can lead to skillful predictions and realistic ensemble traces in several locations in SA, even if in situ hydrometeorological observations are not available in real time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in Chilean temperate forests which extend along western South America from latitude 29° S to 56° S. This geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation, edaphic, topographic, geologic, and climatic settings which create a unique natural laboratory. Many local communities, endangered freshwater ecosystems, and downstream economic activities in Chile rely on water flows from forested catchments. This review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of Chilean forest hydrology, to (ii) review prior research in forest hydrology in Chile, and to (iii) identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in Chile. We reviewed the relation between native forests, commercial plantations, and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale. Much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here. Streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting, native forests appear to use less water than plantations, and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland/shrublands. We identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems, soil–plant-atmosphere interactions, native forest hydrology, and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology. Also, we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types (35-36°S); most forest hydrology studies in Chile (56%) have been conducted in the southern area (Los Rios Region around 39-40° S). There is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover. There is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process-based investigations linking field studies and modeling. Through the establishment of a forest hydrology science “society” to coordinate efforts, regional and national-scale land use planning might be supported. Our review ends with a vision to advance a cross-scale collaborative effort to use new nation-wide catchment-scale networks Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) sites, to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies, and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in Chile. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - We combine satellite gravity data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and precipitation measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), over the period from mid-2002 to mid-2006, to investigate the relative importance of sink (runoff and evaporation) and source (precipitation) terms in the hydrological balance of the Amazon Basin. When linear and quadratic terms are removed, the time-series of land water storage variations estimated from GRACE exhibits a dominant annual signal of 250 mm peak-to-peak, which is equivalent to a water volume change of ∼1,800 km3. A comparison of this trend with accumulated (i.e., integrated) precipitation shows excellent agreement and no evidence of basin saturation. The agreement indicates that the net runoff and evaporation contributes significantly less than precipitation to the annual hydrological mass balance. Indeed, raw residuals between the de-trended water storage and precipitation anomalies range from ±40 mm. This range is consistent with stream-flow measurements from the region, although the latter are characterized by a stronger annual signal than our residuals, suggesting that runoff and evaporation may act to partially cancel each other. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

AB  - General circulation models (GCMs) forced under different greenhouse gases emission and socioeconomic scenarios are currently the most extended tool throughout the scientific community that is used to infer the future climate on Earth. However, these models still have problems in capturing several aspects of regional climate variability in many parts of the globe. In this paper, the hydrological cycle of the La Plata Basin is simulated using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) distributed hydrology model and forced with atmospheric data from different GCMs to determine to what extent errors in temperature and precipitation fields impact the hydrology of the basin. The skill assessment is performed in terms of simulated runoff at different closing points. Simulated hydrographs show that all of the GCMs present deficiencies in simulating the regional climatology of southern South America, and this leads to a very poor representation of the hydrological cycle of the main rivers across the basin. Two unbiasing schemes are then proposed as a means of correcting the GCM outputs before forcing the hydrology model, and comparisons between biased and unbiased simulations are also performed. Results indicate that both schemes, though methodologically different, reduce the water cycle simulation bias. Finally, VIC is forced with bias-corrected data from the GCMs for future decades (2030 and 2070) under different socioeconomic scenarios [e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) scenarios A1B, A2, and B1] to determine the potential changes in streamflow due to climate change for the rest of the present century. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Salinity changes in the Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta and Pajarales Complex coastal lagoon system in northern Colombia, and their relation with local rainfall, tributaries' streamflow and ENSO, are analyzed. Being markedly low (<1321 mm yr-1), local rainfall is assumed to be insignificant for mean salinity changes. The non-linear model proposed explains the variations in salinity and tributaries' streamflow with ENSO intensity, measured as Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly. Streamflows are directly and salinity inversely correlated with SOI. Model analysis allowed to discriminate between natural and hydraulic management situations and also how the occurrence of different environmental scenarios reflected on salinity changes. The link between global climate variability and local conditions becomes clearer and worthy to be brought into account in management and decision making processes dealing with continental as well as other marine and coastal aquatic environments in the Caribbean region. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Point validation of land surface schemes in general circulation models (GCMs) can only provide limited insight into the performance of the schemes when used over the large GCM grid cells. Streamflow, which integrates information over large areas, is a potentially useful diagnostic for assessing the land surface schemes at large spatial scales. This paper discusses the use of streamflow for assessing the performance of the CSIRO9 land surface scheme over the Amazon and the Mississippi River Basins. The paper shows that although streamflow can be a useful diagnostic tool for testing land surface schemes over large scales its utility is undermined by various problems: the atmospheric control on evapotranspiration, the possibility of compensating errors within large basins, and most importantly the lack of reliable grid-averaged atmospheric data at large spatial scales.

AB  - Riparian wetlands have been disappearing at an accelerating rate. Their ecological integrity as well as their vital ecosystem services for humankind depend on regular patterns of inundation and drying provided by natural flow regimes. However, river hydrology has been altered worldwide. Dams cause less variable flow regimes and water abstractions decrease the amount of flow so that ecologically important flood pulses are often reduced. Given growing population pressure and projected climate change, immediate action is required. However, the implementation of counteractive measures is often a complex task. This study develops a screening tool for assessing hydrological threats to riparian wetlands on global scales. The approach is exemplified on 93 Ramsar sites, many of which are located in transboundary basins. First, the WaterGAP3 hydrological modeling framework is used to quantitatively compare current and future modified flow regimes to reference flow conditions. In our simulations current water resource management seriously impairs riparian wetland inundation at 29 % of the analyzed sites. A further 8 % experience significantly reduced flood pulses. In the future, eastern Europe, western Asia, as well as central South America could be hotspots of further flow modifications due to climate change. Second, a qualitative analysis of the 93 sites determined potential impact on overbank flows resulting from planned or proposed dam construction projects. They take place in one-third of the upstream areas and are likely to impair especially wetlands located in South America, Asia, and the Balkan Peninsula. Third, based on the existing legal/institutional framework and water resource availability upstream, further qualitative analysis evaluated the capacity to preserve overbank flows given future streamflow changes due to dam construction and climate change. Results indicate hotspots of vulnerability exist, especially in northern Africa and the Persian Gulf. © Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Worldwide, 98% of total electricity is currently produced by thermoelectric power and hydropower. Climate change is expected to directly impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential impacts of climate change on global hydropower and cooling water discharge potential. For the first time, combined projections of streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The ensemble projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and cooling water discharge capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross hydropower potential is expected to increase between +2.4% (GCM-GHM ensemble mean for RCP 2.6) and +6.3% (RCP 8.5) for the 2080s compared to 1971–2000. The strongest increases in hydropower potential are expected for Central Africa, India, central Asia and the northern high-latitudes, with 18–33% of the world population living in these areas by the 2080s. Global mean cooling water discharge capacity is projected to decrease by 4.5-15% (2080s). The largest reductions are found for the United States, Europe, eastern Asia, and southern parts of South America, Africa and Australia, where strong water temperature increases are projected combined with reductions in mean annual streamflow. These regions are expected to affect 11–14% (for RCP2.6 and the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)1, SSP2, SSP4) and 41–51% (RCP8.5–SSP3, SSP5) of the world population by the 2080s. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water resources planning and management efficacy is subject to capturing inherent uncertainties stemming from climatic and hydrological inputs and models. Streamflow forecasts, critical in reservoir operation and water allocation decision making, fundamentally contain uncertainties arising from assumed initial conditions, model structure, and modeled processes. Accounting for these propagating uncertainties remains a formidable challenge. Recent enhancements in climate forecasting skill and hydrological modeling serve as an impetus for further pursuing models and model combinations capable of delivering improved streamflow forecasts. However, little consideration has been given to methodologies that include coupling both multiple climate and multiple hydrological models, increasing the pool of streamflow forecast ensemble members and accounting for cumulative sources of uncertainty. The framework presented here proposes integration and offline coupling of global climate models (GCMs), multiple regional climate models, and numerous water balance models to improve streamflow forecasting through generation of ensemble forecasts. For demonstration purposes, the framework is imposed on the Jaguaribe basin in northeastern Brazil for a hindcast of 1974-1996 monthly streamflow. The ECHAM 4.5 and the NCEP-MRF9 GCMs and regional models, including dynamical and statistical models, are integrated with the ABCD and Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure water balance models. Precipitation hindcasts from the GCMs are downscaled via the regional models and fed into the water balance models, producing streamflow hindcasts. Multi-model ensemble combination techniques include pooling, linear regression weighting, and a kernel density estimator to evaluate streamflow hindcasts; the latter technique exhibits superior skill compared with any single coupled model ensemble hindcast. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.

AB  - The understanding of the long-term variation of large rivers streamflow with a high economic and social relevance is necessary in order to improve the planning and management of water resources in different regions of the world. The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20°S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100m3s-1 at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29,000km2 shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765-2004. Summer streamflow represents 45.2% of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (1961-2004) explains 54% of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R2adj=0.54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980s (τ=-0.633, p=1.0144*10-5 for the 1985-2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765. The Correlation of the Baker streamflow with the November-April observed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is significant (1961-2004, r=-0.55, p<0.001). The Baker record is also correlated with the available SAM tree-ring reconstruction based on other species when both series are filtered with a 25-year spline and detrended (1765-2004, r=-0.41, p<0.01), emphasizing SAM as the main climatic forcing of the Baker streamflow. Three of the five summers with the highest streamflow in the entire reconstructed record occurred after the 1950s (1977, 1958 and 1959). The causes of this high streamflow events are not yet clear and cannot be associated with the reported recent increase in the frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The decreasing trend in the observed and reconstructed streamflow of the Baker River documented here for the 1980-2004 period is consistent with precipitation decrease associated with the SAM. Conversely, other studies have reported an increase of summer streamflow for a portion of the Baker River for the 1994-2008 period, explained by ice melt associated with temperature increase and glacier retreat and thinning.Future research should consider the development of new tree-ring reconstructions to increase the geographic range and to cover the last 1000 or more years using long-lived species (e.g. Fitzroya cupressoides and Pilgerodendron uviferum). Expanding the network and quality of instrumental weather, streamflow and other monitoring stations as well as the study and modeling of the complex hydrological processes in the Baker basin are necessary. This should be the basis for planning, policy design and decision making regarding water resources in the Baker basin. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forecasts of inflow into major reservoirs of the Brazilian hydroelectric power system are needed for the operational planning over periods ranging from a few hours to several months ahead. Medium-range forecasts of the order of a few days to two weeks have usually been obtained by simple ARMA-type models, which do not utilize information on observed or forecast precipitation, nor streamflow observations from upstream gauging stations. Recently, several different hydrological models have been tested to assess the potential improvements in forecasts that could be obtained by using observed and forecast precipitation as additional inputs. We present results from the use of a large-scale hydrological model applied to part of the Paranaíba river basin between Itumbiara and São Simão power plants (75,000 km2) using precipitation forecasts from the regional Eta model run by the Brazilian Center for Weather Prediction (CPTEC). Results were compared with those from the currently-used ARMA model and it is shown that forecast errors can be reduced considerably, during both wet and dry seasons. Further reductions in prediction errors may be anticipated from improved rainfall forecasts and of data quality used by the hydrological model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper discusses evidence that common assumptions in the analysis of hydrological time series (homogeneous variability in random fluctuations about a constant mean value) may not be appropriate for some South American drainage basins. Relatively rapid changes have occurred, and are occurring, as a consequence of replacing mature forest by short crops and urban development. Some research claims to have detected non-linear trends in stream flow in rivers draining the south-eastern part of the sub-continent, together with decadal fluctuations and interannual peaks at ENSO timescales. The paper discusses the implications of such changes for hydrological practices now in widespread and largely unquestioned use.

AB  - Due to global warming the climate of central Chile is expected to experience dramatic changes in the 21st century including declining precipitation, earlier streamflow peaks, and a greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain. We used 12-member ensembles of General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) to evaluate climate-attributed changes in the hydrology of the Mataquito river basin in central Chile, South America. Simulations using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model indicate that a drier and warmer future will shift the location of snow line to higher elevations and reduce the number of days with precipitation falling as snow. Extreme precipitation and streamflow events are expected to become more frequent. Conversely, low flow conditions will intensify during the warm months. The changes in the mean of hydrologic states and fluxes by the end of the 21st century are statistically robust, whereas changes in the variance are not found to be statistically significant. Results of the ensembles for CMIP3 and CMIP5 are generally indistinguishable regarding projected impacts on hydrology. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Streamflow forecasts from continental to global scale hydrological models have gained attention, but their performance against operational forecasts at local to regional scales must be evaluated. This study assesses the skill of medium-range, weekly streamflow forecasts for 147 large Brazilian hydropower plants (HPPs) and compares their performance with forecasts issued operationally by the National Electric System Operator (ONS). A continental-scale hydrological model was forced with ECMWF medium-range forecasts, and outputs were corrected using quantile mapping (QM) and autoregressive model approaches. By using both corrections, the percentage of HPPs with skillful forecasts against climatology and persistence for 1–7 days ahead increased substantially for low to moderate (9% to 56%) and high (72% to 94%) flows, while using only the QM correction allowed positive skill mainly for low to moderate flows and for 8–15 days ahead (29% to 64%). Compared with the ONS, the corrected continental-scale forecasts issued for the first week exhibited equal or better performance in 60% of the HPPs, especially for the North and Southeast subsystems, the DJF and MAM months, and for HPPs with less installed capacity. The findings suggest that using simple corrections on streamflow forecasts issued by continental-scale models can result in competitive forecasts even for regional-scale applications. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The snowpack in the central Andes (30°-37°S) is the primary source for streamflow in central Chile and central-western Argentina, but few published studies are available on snowpack variability in the region. This paper develops the first regional snowpack series (1951-2005) from Chilean and Argentinean snow course records. This series shows a strong regional signal, marked interannual variability, and a positive, though nonsignificant, linear trend. Correlations with local precipitation and temperature records reveal a marked association with conditions in central Chile. High snow accumulation is generally concurrent with El Niño events in the tropical Pacific, but only 5 of the 10 driest years coincided with La Niña events. Evaluation of 500-hPa geopotential height anomaly maps during extreme snow years highlights the crucial significance of tropospheric conditions in the subtropical and southeast Pacific in modulating snowfall. Correlations with gridded SST and SLP data and multiple regressions with large-scale climatic indices corroborate a Pacific ENSO-related influence largely concentrated during the austral winter months. This hampers the predictability of snowpack before the onset of the cold season. Annual and warm-season river discharges on both sides of the cordillera are significantly correlated with the regional snowpack record and show positive linear trends over the 1951-2004 common period, probably related to a greater frequency of above-average snowpacks during recent decades. Future demand and competition for water resources in these highly populated regions will require detailed information about temporal and spatial variations in snow accumulation over the Andes. The results indicate that the relationships between snowpack and atmospheric circulation patterns prior to the winter season are complex, and more detailed analyses are necessary to improve prediction of winter snowfall totals. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Sustainable management of water ecosystem services requires reliable information to support decision making. We evaluate the performance of the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield Model (SWYM) against water monitoring records in 224 catchments in southern Chile. We run the SWYM in three years (1998, 2007 and 2013) to account for recent land-use change and climatic variations. We computed squared Pearson correlations between SWYM monthly quickflow predictions and streamflow observations and applied a generalized mixed‐effects model to evaluate annual estimations. Results show relatively low monthly correlations with marked latitudinal and temporal variations while annual estimates show a good match between observed and modeled values, especially for values under 1000 mm/year. Better predictions were observed in regions with high rainfall and in dry years while poorer predictions were found in snow dominated and drier regions. Our results improve SWYM performance and contribute to water supply and regulation decision-making, particularly in data scarce regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Study region: A total of 11,913 sub-catchments in Peru and transboundary catchments with neighboring countries in South America. Study focus: This paper aims to develop a national hydrological model using physiographic and climatic characteristics to identify donor and receptor sub-catchments (sub-zones). Therefore, we use the hydrometeorological PISCO dataset (0.1º x 0.1º) to drive a sub-catchment conceptual rainfall-runoff (ARNO/VIC) model and a river-routing (RAPID) model in thousands of river reaches. We identify 43 hydrological zones (with 122 sub-zones) to run the hybrid hydrological modeling framework (ARNO/VIC+RAPID) with previously calibrated and validated parameters with 43 fluviometric stations for 1981–2020. Simulated flow series show a higher performance at daily scale (KGE ≥ 0.75, NSEsqrt ≥ 0.65, MARE ≤ 1, and −25% ≤ PBIAS ≤ 25%) for catchments located at the Pacific coast and the Andes-Amazon transition, and good representation (R≥0.75) of seasonal and interannual variability. New hydrological insights for the region: Increasing hydrological hazards such as floods highlight the importance of a systematic hydrological analysis and modeling at national level in gauged and ungauged catchments in Peru. This study introduces a new hydrological dataset of simulated daily flow series. The results are helpful for short-term flood risk scenario simulations and long-term water resource planning as the outcomes can provide valuable information for hydrologists and water resource managers in Peruvian regions with limited or no access to in-situ networks. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Key Points Global bimonthly streamflow forecasts show potentially valuable skill Initial catchment conditions are responsible for most skill Skill can be estimated from model performance and theoretical skill Ideally, a seasonal streamflow forecasting system would ingest skilful climate forecasts and propagate these through calibrated hydrological models initialized with observed catchment conditions. At global scale, practical problems exist in each of these aspects. For the first time, we analyzed theoretical and actual skill in bimonthly streamflow forecasts from a global ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) system. Forecasts were generated six times per year for 1979-2008 by an initialized hydrological model and an ensemble of 1° resolution daily climate estimates for the preceding 30 years. A post-ESP conditional sampling method was applied to 2.6% of forecasts, based on predictive relationships between precipitation and 1 of 21 climate indices prior to the forecast date. Theoretical skill was assessed against a reference run with historic forcing. Actual skill was assessed against streamflow records for 6192 small (<10,000 km2) catchments worldwide. The results show that initial catchment conditions provide the main source of skill. Post-ESP sampling enhanced skill in equatorial South America and Southeast Asia, particularly in terms of tercile probability skill, due to the persistence and influence of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Actual skill was on average 54% of theoretical skill but considerably more for selected regions and times of year. The realized fraction of the theoretical skill probably depended primarily on the quality of precipitation estimates. Forecast skill could be predicted as the product of theoretical skill and historic model performance. Increases in seasonal forecast skill are likely to require improvement in the observation of precipitation and initial hydrological conditions. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The Baker basin (27 000 km2) is located in one of the most pristine and remote areas of the planet. Its hydrological regime is poised to undergo dramatic changes in the near future due to hydropower development and climate change. The basin contains the second-largest lake in South America, and part of a major icefield. This study documents the natural baseline of the Baker River basin, discusses the main hydrological modes and analyses the potential for sustainable management. Annual precipitation varies several-fold from the eastern Patagonian steppes to the North Patagonian Icefield. The westernmost sub-basins are strongly governed by glacier melt with a peak discharge in the austral summer (January-March). The easternmost sub-basins have a much more seasonal response governed by quicker snowmelt in spring (November-December), while they exhibit low flows typical for semi-arid regions during summer and autumn. Topography, vegetation and wetlands may also influence streamflow. The strong spatio-temporal gradients and variability highlight the need for further monitoring, particularly in the headwaters, especially given the severe changes these basins are expected to undergo. The great diversity of hydrological controls and climate change pose significant challenges for hydrological prediction and management. © 2012 Copyright 2012 IAHS Press.
