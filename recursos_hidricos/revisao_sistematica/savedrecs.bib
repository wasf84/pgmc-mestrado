Abstract = {One of the strategies proposed for reducing nitrate losses from
   subsurface tile drain systems in Midwestern agricultural lands,
   controlled drainage, is known to reduce drain flow on an annual basis,
   but is not well understood for individual events. Understanding
   hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from free and controlled
   drainage systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on
   the overall functioning of these systems so that they can be better
   managed or retrofitted to increase their environmental benefits. This
   study used data from a monitoring site in east central Indiana to
   investigate the hydrology of 22 drainage events in free and controlled
   subsurface drainage systems. Relationships between event drainage
   volume, drain flow hydrograph metrics, column soil moisture, water table
   depth, and precipitation time series for each event were explored to
   determine the effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent
   conditions on these metrics. Controlled drainage reduced event drainage
   volume and peak flows by 22\% +/- 12\% and 29\% +/- 16\% respectively,
   and increased the time to peak of drainage by 98\% +/- 52\%. Higher
   total precipitation and precipitation time spread increased
   infiltration, while the average precipitation intensity did not
   correlate with drainage volumes in either system. Peak flow rate in free
   draining quadrants were positively affected by higher precipitation and
   average precipitation intensity, while in managed quadrants, the
   antecedent soil moisture appeared to be more influential in affecting
   peak flow rate than precipitation characteristics. Surface runoff
   potential increased with the increase in average precipitation intensity
   in all quadrants. Saturation excess ponding or possibly overland flow
   occurred in events that have a low average precipitation intensity, and
   a high precipitation time spread. Field observations indicate that
   saturation excess overland flow was more pronounced in controlled
   quadrants because water table levels rose higher than the water table
   levels of their free draining counterpart.},

Title = {The dual synchronizing influences of precipitation and land use on
   stream properties in a rapidly urbanizing watershed},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Conversion of natural ecosystems to urbanized land cover dominated by
   impervious surfaces can alter hydrologic delivery of terrestrially
   derived materials to aquatic ecosystems. By changing hydrologic regimes,
   urbanization has important ramifications for water quality, particularly
   when considering how land use change might interact with other potential
   environmental stressors. Here, we analyzed a suite of physical,
   chemical, and biological time series (2007-2008) in 11 streams in a
   rapidly urbanizing watershed to determine how spatiotemporal synchrony
   is structured in urban vs. rural stream ecosystems. We further assessed
   how a doubling of seasonal precipitation influenced the landscape-level
   stream synchrony patterns between years via changes to the local
   hydrologic regime. Consistent with existing theory and observations,
   physical variables (i.e., water temperature, flow rate) regulated by
   external climate features operating at broad spatial scales were more
   synchronous than the variables associated with fluxes of dissolved
   solutes (i.e., conductivity, salinity, dissolved nutrients), which are
   typically controlled by local and internal ecosystem processes. Both
   urbanization and increased precipitation modified synchrony patterns by
   increasing the temporal coherence of water flow and the concentration of
   certain dissolved solutes (i.e., conductivity, salinity). Urban streams
   exposed to more precipitation exhibited the greatest similarity in
   physicochemical conditions, suggesting an interaction among the dual
   stressors of precipitation and urbanization to instill ecosystem
   synchrony. These results suggest that taking a spatially explicit
   perspective in understanding urbanization and its interactions with a
   changing climate is critical for the future management of aquatic
   resources in highly developed landscapes.},

Abstract = {The channel of the lower Rio Grande in the Big Bend National Park Region
   rapidly narrows during drought years of low mean and peak flow, while
   the channel resets during larger flooding period. The channel narrowing
   causes increasing flooding potential, decreasing hyporheic exchange, and
   increasing nutrient loading, temperatures and total dissolved solid. The
   objective of this study is to collect and analyze field data, and
   perform hydrological, hydraulic and sediment analyses to assess channel
   change under different climate conditions, and to predict the impacts of
   flood and climate changes in the region. The historical data of the
   precipitations in the basin and floods in the channel have been analyzed
   to understand the hydrologic conditions. The analysis of river water
   quality data demonstrates that the pH value, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and
   Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) generally decrease when the flow rate
   increases immediately following precipitation events. A hydraulic
   (HEC-RAS) model in the Santa Elena, Jonson and Boquillas reaches was
   developed and calibrated to provide the framework for the sediment
   transport model. The geometric portion of the model consists of a series
   of cross-section profiles of the river and overbank area based on field
   surveyed data. Appropriate roughness values (Manning's n values),
   expansion and contraction loss coefficients, and downstream boundary
   conditions were incorporated into the model input. The model was then
   calibrated using USGS gage data. With available sediment grain size
   data, a one-dimensional (1-D) sediment model was developed using HEC-RAS
   to quantify the total sediment load and the river bed elevation change
   under different flooding conditions. This work is part of the effort to
   quantify the impact of global climate change on flood and sediment
   transport and to provide alternative options for the sustainable use of
   low Rio Grande River water.},

Abstract = {River is one part of the hydrologic cycle. Water in rivers is generally
   collected from precipitation, such as rain, dew, springs, underground
   runoff, and in certain countries also comes from melt ice/snow. The
   height and speed of water in a river is always changing. Changes in
   altitude and speed of water can affect the surrounding environment. In
   this paper, we will design a system to measure the altitude and speed of
   the river. In this work we use Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors and flow
   rate sensors. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 is used as a river height meter.
   Based on the test results, this sensor has an accuracy of 96.6\%.},

Title = {Factors Controlling the Hydraulic Efficiency of Green Roofs in the

Abstract = {Green roofs (GRs) are considered sustainable solutions for the
   adaptation of urban water management to climate change. The use of GRs
   is particularly promising in urban environments like the Metropolitan
   Area of Milan, the most urbanized area in Italy. In this work, we
   evaluated the subsurface runoff coefficient at the event-time scale, for
   more than one year of observations, of 68 small-scale test beds
   comprising different configurations of green roofs (e.g., different
   vegetations, types and depths of growing media, and different slopes)
   installed in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. The objectives of this
   study are three-fold. Firstly, the controlling factors of the hydraulic
   have been assessed for efficiency. We calculated a mean drainage flow
   rate of 51\%, finding that growing media play a significant role in
   determining the drainage flow during the spring, at the beginning of the
   vegetative period. During this season, water retention in fertilized
   beds increases significantly. At the beginning of the summer, the
   vegetation cover is able to significantly reduce the drainage flow,
   playing an even more crucial role with respect to the growing medium
   material. However, we found that the vegetation type (grass field and
   Sedum) does not play a significant role in the retention processes.
   Secondly, the delay of the peak flow rate was determined. We found a
   precipitation peak delay from 1 to 2 h, which would be sufficient to
   guarantee environmental benefits for urban drainage. Finally, the
   factors controlling the hydraulic efficiency of GRs for individual
   precipitation events were assessed. We found that soil moisture and
   cumulated precipitation are both significant factors determining the
   drainage flow rate. In conclusion, we point out that soil moisture is
   one of the main parameters characterizing GR drainage and should be
   further considered in future research efforts devoted to the analysis of
   GR performance.},

Abstract = {Changes in environmental flow regime due to hydraulic construction
   projects and variability in precipitation patterns due to climate change
   over the past several years have increased the stress on ecohydrology,
   and the indiscreet use of water has had a negative impact on the water
   environment in natural rivers and hydro structures. Previous studies on
   typhoon precipitation have simply estimated the intensity, duration,
   frequency, and magnitude of typhoon precipitations, but the study of the
   effects on water resource and ecosystem operations by separating typhoon
   precipitations from warm season precipitations was relatively
   inadequate. Therefore, this study investigated the characteristics of
   quantitative hydrological changes related to daily flow data of dam
   inflows considering the effects of the typhoon. According to the peak
   flow rate and frequency analysis, there is a distinct increase trend in
   the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Also, during non-typhoon
   periods, low flow rates are frequent, but low-flow changes due to
   typhoons are not significant. The results of this study could be used as
   a useful resource for establishing scientific measures for the
   preparation and coordination of responses to the changes in water and
   ecological environment systems in a changing climate.},

Title = {Self organizing hydrological processes in a runoff source area},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {211},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Understanding the hydrology of runoff source areas is crucial for
   predicting floods and evaluating chemical transport. Numerically
   modeling water fluxes in the source areas is quite complex. However, the
   self-organization of complex hydrological systems makes it possible to
   simplify watershed models by considering the landscape functions. The
   limitation is that input values are not known a priori. This study seeks
   to find the soil physical parameters governing the hydrology of runoff
   source areas in humid climates and use them in a surrogate simulation
   model to predict the runoff and the perched water table height. The site
   chosen was a 5.4-ha, periodically saturated runoff source area with a
   shallow perched water table and a humid temperate climate. The only
   inflow was from precipitation. Perched water table depths at five
   locations and the outflow were measured continuously. Measurements
   showed that the outflow was negligible 24 h after a rain event. It
   indicated that a quasi-static equilibrium had been established, in which
   the capillary pressure decreased linearly with depth to zero at the
   shallow groundwater. The soil-water retention function determined the
   soil water distribution and the drainable porosity. Runoff was generated
   by saturation excess and equaled the rainfall minus the empty pore
   volume. Based on these observations, a simple spreadsheet-based
   surrogate model was developed to calculate the air-filled pore volume by
   accounting for daily precipitation and evaporation. The surrogate model
   accurately predicted daily discharge and water table height using
   climatic data and a literature-based water retention function. In our
   case, the quasi-static equilibrium was restored within a day. Thus, the
   small-scale nonlinear physics that determines the soil's water flow rate
   before equilibrium is reached were irrelevant when the time step is one
   day. Studies in similar runoff source areas could utilize this approach
   and create their specific surrogate models.},

Abstract = {Impact of drought stress on terrestrial plants is predicted to increase
   in future due to rapid increase in air temperature and changes in
   precipitation patterns. Mulberry (Morus spp.) is an economically
   important perennial crop in sericulture industry. The present study was
   aimed at using hydraulic dynamics and photosynthetic performance for
   screening drought tolerance among mulberry genotypes by using
   non-invasive, rapid and efficient methods. Plant hydraulic variables
   were measured with commercially available sap flow meter, stem and leaf
   psychrometers in one year old mulberry genotypes. Plant leaf gas
   exchange parameters and chlorophyll alpha fluorescence were measured in
   control and stressed plants to assess their efficiency. Based on
   hydraulics and photosynthetic parameters, mulberry genotypes were
   characterized into 3 functional groups including high, average and poor
   performing groups (HPG, APG and LPG respectively). HPG genotypes
   maintained significantly better leaf water status (psi(md)), stem
   hydraulic conductance (K-s) and sap flow rate (F) which resulted in
   enhanced photosynthetic efficiency compared to APG, LPG under prolonged
   drought regimes as well as after recovery. Hydraulic parameters were
   positively correlated with photosynthetic performance of each group
   under drought. Our data suggest that plant water transport efficiency
   plays a major role in regulating photosynthetic performance which in
   turn determines the biomass yields under drought. Hydraulic dynamics
   based screening will be highly useful for rapid selection of efficient
   mulberry genotypes.},

Title = {Effect of an incremental change in external water pressure on tunnel
   lining: a case study from the Tongxi karst tunnel},

Abstract = {Tunnel water inrush disaster is a serious problem in karst tunnel
   construction and occurs extensively in southwestern China. To prevent
   water inrush, hydraulic lining has been utilized extensively in karst
   tunnel construction. The failure of the hydraulic lining in the Tongxi
   tunnel is an example of a typical failure case that has yet to be fully
   analyzed. In this paper, the failure of the waterproof liner was studied
   by theoretical and numerical methods. By field investigation, the
   failure of the tunnel lining was attributed to a high hydraulic pressure
   head converging in the large karst caves behind the lining. The
   corresponding mechanical model can be simplified as a ``karst cave water
   pressure{''} model. The key to the mechanical model was to determine the
   water pressure of the karst caves produced by the lining. The variation
   in water pressure was directly related to the cave' reservoir volume,
   catchment flow and catchment time. Thus, volume calculation formulas for
   two types of karst caves (strike and oblique caves) in the studied
   tunnel were constructed based on the engineering geological conditions.
   Considering the precipitation, the flow rate in the karst caves was
   regarded as nearly constant during the catchment period. Hence,
   reservoir volumes during different periods can be calculated and
   converted to the stress boundary conditions of the lining. Then, the
   mechanical response of the tunnel under different water levels was
   calculated by numerical simulation. Combining the field investigation
   and monitoring data, the tunnel lining failure was mainly believed to be
   triggered by hydraulic fracturing failure due to a high-pressure head.
   Finally, prevention measures were proposed based on the results of this
   study.},

Abstract = {Quantification of groundwater recharge from precipitation in the huge
   sand dunes is an issue in accounting for regional water balance in the
   Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) where about 100 lakes exist between dunes. In
   this study, field observations were conducted on a sand dune near a
   large saline lake in the BJD to investigate soil water movement through
   a thick vadose zone for groundwater estimation. The hydraulic properties
   of the soils at the site were determined using in situ experiments and
   laboratory measurements. A HYDRUS-1D model was built up for simulating
   the coupling processes of vertical water-vapor movement and heat
   transport in the desert soil. The model was well calibrated and
   validated using the site measurements of the soil water and temperature
   at various depths. Then, the model was applied to simulate the vertical
   flow across a 3-m-depth soil during a 53-year period under variable
   climate conditions. The simulated flow rate at the depth is an
   approximate estimation of groundwater recharge from the precipitation in
   the desert. It was found that the annual groundwater recharge would be
   11-30 mm during 1983-2012, while the annual precipitation varied from 68
   to 172 mm in the same period. The recharge rates are significantly
   higher than those estimated from the previous studies using chemical
   information. The modeling results highlight the role of the local
   precipitation as an essential source of groundwater in the BJD. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Travertine crystal growth ripples are used to reconstruct the early
   hydraulic history of the Anio Novus aqueduct of ancient Rome. These
   crystalline morphologies deposited within the aqueduct channel record
   the hydraulic history of gravity-driven turbulent flow at the time of
   Roman operation. The wavelength, amplitude, and steepness of these
   travertine crystal growth ripples indicate that large-scale sustained
   aqueduct flows scaled directly with the thickness of the aqueous viscous
   sublayer. Resulting critical shear Reynolds numbers are comparable with
   those reconstructed from heat/mass transfer crystalline ripples formed
   in other natural and engineered environments. This includes sediment
   transport in rivers, lakes, and oceans, chemical precipitation and
   dissolution in caves, and melting and freezing in ice. Where flow depth
   and perimeter could be reconstructed from the distribution and
   stratigraphy of the travertine within the Anio Novus aqueduct, flow
   velocity and rate have been quantified by deriving roughness-flow
   relationships that are independent of water temperature. More generally,
   under conditions of near-constant water temperature and kinematic
   viscosity within the Anio Novus aqueduct channel, the travertine crystal
   growth ripple wavelengths increased with decreasing flow velocity,
   indicating that systematic changes took place in flow rate during
   travertine deposition. This study establishes that travertine crystal
   growth ripples such as those preserved in the Anio Novus provide a
   sensitive record of past hydraulic conditions, which can be similarly
   reconstructed from travertine deposited in other ancient water
   conveyance and storage systems around the world.},

Abstract = {In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) method was applied to
   investigate the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and
   quality of the Qu'Appelle River in Saskatchewan, Canada. First, the
   second-generation Canadian earth system model (CanESM2) was adopted to
   predict future climate conditions. The Statistical DownScaling Model
   (SDSM) was then applied to downscale the generated data. To analyze the
   water quality of the river, concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   total dissolved solids (TDSs) from the river were collected. Using the
   collected climate and hydrometric data, the ANNs were trained to
   simulate (i) the ratio of snowfall-to-total precipitation based on the
   temperature, (ii) the river flow rate based on the temperature and
   precipitation; and (iii) DO and TDS concentrations based on the river
   flow and temperature. Finally, the generated climate change data were
   used as inputs to the ANN model to investigate the climate change
   impacts on the river flow as well as DO and TDS concentrations within
   the selected region. Hydrologic alteration of the river was evaluated
   via the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) under historical and climate
   change scenarios. The results under climate change scenarios were
   compared with those under historical scenarios and indicated that
   climate change would lead to a heterogeneous change in precipitation and
   temperature patterns. These changes would have serious degrading impacts
   on the river discharge as well as DO and TDS concentration levels,
   causing deterioration in the sustainability of the river system and
   ecological health of the region.},

Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major crop on the Loess Plateau, and
   calculating the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) of
   maize is important for estimating field water balance. In this study,
   the sap flow method was adopted to measure transpiration (T)
   characteristics of maize. In order to calibrate the sap flow gauge, the
   sap flow rate was compared to the leaf T determined by the weighing
   method. The sap flow value was measured per hour for 3 days and the mean
   of the hourly values for each day was taken as the daily value to avoid
   the influence of hydraulic capacitance. There was a significant linear
   relationship between leaf T and sap flow rate. The slope and intercept
   of linear regression were 0.764 and 4.944, with an R-2 of 0.97 (p <
   0.01). We also analyzed the T and ET of maize under field conditions.
   The T/ET of maize was 63.3\% from July to September 2012. The T/ET and
   leaf area index had a good linear relationship. Partitioning of ET into
   soil evaporation (E) and T may have important implications for analyzing
   crop water use efficiency, evaluating the crop production potential of
   precipitation and optimizing field water management.},

Title = {Identification, Calibration and Validation of Hydrodynamic Model of

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Sewerage system operation modeling is rarely applied in Poland, mainly
   due to lack of necessary input databases as well as methodological basis
   still under development. In the paper, land drainage mathematical
   modeling using SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) software was revised,
   based on the example of stormwater catchment and its drainage system for
   the city of Wroclaw. Research pilot catchment selection criteria were
   developed as well as principles of local database creation for rainfall
   events and wastewater stream measurements from sewage collectors over a
   minimum 2-year period. New rules of hydrological and hydraulic parameter
   identification were proposed for hydrodynamic models during their
   calibration and validation, taking into account rainfalls for sewage
   system sizing and overload verification. Statistical criteria were
   proposed for model quality evaluation, usually employed to compare
   simulation results of the stormwater runoff flow rate (Q) and runoff
   volume (V) for the effective precipitation with the measurement data.
   The methodical aspect of the results presented is of a universal nature.
   Thus the results can be applied for identification, calibration and
   validation of hydrodynamic precipitation-runoff models (also outside
   Wroclaw). It was proposed that parameter identification of hydrological
   and hydraulic models of stormwater catchments with drainage systems
   performed using the SWMM software took into account spatiotemporal
   changes in rainfall intensity (e.g. using Surfer software).},

Abstract = {The impact of a natural wetland ({''}dambo{''} in Zambia) on neutral
   mine drainage at Luanshya in the Zambian Copperbelt has been
   investigated during an intermediate discharge period (July) using a
   multi-method characterization of solid phase samples, sequential
   extraction analysis, X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy combined with water analyses, isotopic
   analyses, and geochemical modeling. In the wetland, the principal
   identified solid phases in sediments were carbonates, gypsum, and ferric
   oxyhydroxides. A significant portion of the ochres was present as
   insoluble hematite. Mine drainage pH values decrease, and log P-CO2
   values increase after inflow of water into the wetland; dissolved and
   suspended concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Co also decrease. Based on
   speciation calculations, there is no precipitation of secondary Cu and
   Co minerals in the period of sampling, but it can occur later in dry
   period when the flow rate is reduced. Concentrations of sulfate
   decrease, and values of delta S-34(SO4) in the wetland increase in
   parallel, suggesting sulfate reduction is occurring. In more advanced
   dry period, the discharge in mine drainage stream is probably much lower
   and water can reach supersaturation with respect to minerals such as
   gypsum, which has been found in sediments. Wetlands have a positive
   impact on mine drainage water quality due to the removal of metals by
   adsorption, co-precipitation, and filtration of colloids. However, there
   can also be a rebound of contamination by seepage inflow downstream from
   the wetland. Ongoing climate change with extreme hydrologic events may
   enhance differences between dry and rainy seasons with resulting faster
   mobilization of contaminants.},

Title = {Influence of Viscoelastic Surfactant Fracturing Fluids on Modified Coal
   Fracture Flow Characteristics},

Abstract = {Ecofriendly viscoelastic surfactant fracturing fluids (VESFFs) can
   effectively promote the connection of fractures. These can modify the
   fracture surface and change the flow capacity at the pressure-holding
   stage, which affects coalbed methane exploitation. In this study,
   deionized water (DW) and three common VESFFs which, namely, are the
   cationic surfactant fracturing fluid (CSFF), cationic-zwitterionic
   surfactant fracturing fluid (CZSFF), and anionic-zwitterionic surfactant
   fracturing fluid (AZSFF), were used to modify coal fractures for the
   first time. To analyze the flow characteristics of coal fractures, a
   triaxial servo seepage test device was used to conduct the test. The
   variations in fracture surface morphology were analyzed by a
   three-dimensional optical topography scanner, an environmental scanning
   electron microscope, and an X-ray diffractometer. The degree of flow
   capacity improvement following modification by the VESFF decreased in
   the following order: CSFF > AZSFF > CZSFF > DW. At a high confining
   stress (6.1 MPa), DW treatment of the coal fracture decreased the flow
   rate by 26\% and hydraulic aperture by 11.16\%. The CSFF modification of
   the coal fracture increased the flow rate by 18\% and the hydraulic
   aperture by 6.43\%. A new friction factor model with the Reynolds number
   and relative roughness as the variables was proposed, which describes
   the flow characteristics of the gas from laminar to turbulent flow.
   VESFFs affected the flow capacity of coal fractures in five aspects:
   mineral dissolution, mineral precipitation, electrostatic removal of
   coal particles, reduced degree of fracture engagement, and increased
   effective fracture connectivity.},

Abstract = {Because of the problems with sludge formation and inability to meet
   water reuse standards with traditional limestone neutralization,
   nanofiltration (NF) has been evaluated for treatment of abandoned mine
   drainage (AMD). This study contributes to the process of selecting NF
   membranes based on laboratory-scale studies that is validated in
   pilot-scale system with real AMD under relevant process conditions to
   recover: (1) treated water stream (NF permeate) that can serve as a
   substitute for fresh water in industrial applications and (2)
   concentrated sulfate stream (NF reject) that is Well-suited to control
   divalent cations in the produced water from unconventional gas
   extraction by sulfate precipitation and enable its reuse for hydraulic
   fracturing of subsequent wells. Eight commercially available NF
   membranes were tested with Synthetic and real AMD in laboratory-scale
   dead-end. and cross ,flow membrane filtration modules. NP90 membrane was
   selected for pilot-scale study that consisted of aeration and
   sedimentation for iron control, bag filtration and ultrafiltration for
   particulate control and NF. The system was operated for 208 h using real
   AMD at 10 bar and 3.5 GPM feed flow rate and consistently achieved more
   than: 98\% removal of TDS at 57\% water recovery with a nominal pressure
   drop of 1.7 bar. Pressure drop monitoring and water permeability tests
   post pilot:scale study along with chemical equilibrium calculations
   indicated that no fouling/scaling of the membranes occurred.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to study and develop a methodology for the first
   stage of deployment of a Small Hydropower Plant (SHP), the Estimate
   Hydroelectric Potential, stage in which is studied the favorable and
   unfavorable situations to the deployment of small plants. Basing on
   environmental and technical criteria of a watershed, according secondary
   data provided by agencies and institutions responsible for each
   criterion. Data collections for the study observe the geological and
   geotechnical, environmental, infrastructure and logistics, water
   availability and topography aspects. Moreover, it presents the use of
   GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and it uses the Hydrology
   Statistics for the hydrological study, to verify the flow of a river or
   precipitation at a local or region. At the end, it presents the estimate
   average energy generated, or average power, basing first on the
   variation of flow over an average year, and constant height. It was
   applied a study case of the methodology in the watershed of the Tijuco
   river, limited to the city of Ituiutaba - MG. It was found that the
   adopted tool is easy to use, reliable and could be adopted for the
   studies and the calculation of the estimated average energy generated
   from the statistical analysis of the flow rate for the Tijuco River
   provided an attractive potential hydroelectric.},

Title = {Fracture opening or self-sealing: Critical residence time as a unifying
   parameter for cement-CO2-brine interactions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Understanding long-term property evolution of cement fractures is
   essential for assessing well integrity during geological carbon
   sequestration (GCS). Cement fractures represent preferential leakage
   pathways in abandoned wells upon exposure to CO2-rich fluid. Contrasting
   self-sealing and fracture opening behavior have been observed while a
   unifying framework is still missing. Here we developed a process-based
   reactive transport model that explicitly simulates flow and
   multi-component reactive transport in fractured cement by reproducing
   experimental observation of sharp flow rate reduction during exposure to
   carbonated water. The simulation shows similar reaction network as in
   diffusion-controlled systems without flow. That is, the CO2-rich water
   accelerates the portlandite dissolution, releasing calcium that further
   reacted with carbonate to form calcite. The calibrated model was used
   for CO2-flooding numerical experiments in 250 cement fractures with
   varying initial hydraulic aperture (b) and residence time (tau) defined
   as the ratio of fracture volume over flow rate. A long tau leads to slow
   replenishment of carbonated water, calcite precipitation, and
   self-sealing. The opposite occurs when tau is small with short fracture
   and fast flow rates. Simulation results indicate a critical residence
   time tau(c) the minimum tau required for self-sealing - divides the
   conditions that trigger the opening and self-sealing behavior. The
   tau(c) value depends on the initial aperture size through tau(c) = 9.8 x
   10(-4) x b(2) + 0.254 x b.Among the 250 numerical experiments,
   significant changes in effective permeability - self-healing or opening
   - typically occur within hours to a day, thus providing supporting
   argument for the extrapolation of short-term laboratory observation
   (hours to months) to long-term prediction at relevant GCS time scales
   (years to hundreds of years). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Due to the low hydraulic slope of the Kizilirmak River, the water flow
   rate is slow. For this reason, mostly fine-grained materials are
   transported and stored. Since the foundation rock is at lower altitudes,
   the building foundations near Kizilirmak River are mostly built on
   fine-grained material. Structural foundations that are not constructed
   mostly according to the Basic Engineering criteria, cannot exhibit
   solid-rigid behavior if exposed to excessive water effects in events
   such as precipitations and riverbed flood. If the drainage conditions
   are not provided, the negativity increases even more. In this case, the
   fine-grained base material saturated with water shows more plastic
   behavior. Due to the plastic behavior, the building's foundation and
   walls lose their primary feature and are caused to cracks, decomposition
   and then deformations. In this study, soil material parameters and
   drainage conditions are tried to be explained in laboratory conditions
   for the deformations on the structures in the village of Karabucak near
   the Kizilirmak river. In case of interaction of fine-grained cohesion
   materials with water and drainage conditions are not met, it was
   observed that the pore pressure increased when the liquid limit exceeded
   50\%. In cases where the liquid limit exceeds 60\% and the plasticity
   index exceeds 20\%, the potential for swelling and compression
   increases. It has been observed that a high rate of damage occurs in
   these types of structures due to increasing volume changes up to 13\%
   with increasing swelling pressures. Similarly, in terms of shear
   strength, it has been determined that there is a loss of stability in

Title = {How Stress and Temperature Conditions Affect Rock-Fluid Chemistry and
   Mechanical Deformation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {We report the results from a series of chalk flow-through-compaction
   experiments performed at three effective stresses (0.5, 3.5, and
   12.3MPa) and two temperatures (92 and 130 degrees C). The results show
   that both stress and temperature are important to both chemical
   alteration and mechanical deformation. The experiments were conducted on
   cores drilled from the same block of outcrop chalks from the Obourg
   quarry within the Saint Vast formation (Mons, Belgium). The pore
   pressure was kept at 0.7 MPa for all experiments with a continuous flow
   of 0.219 M MgCl2 brine at a constant flow rate; 1 original pore volume
   (PV) per day. The experiments have been performed in tri-axial cells
   with independent control of the external stress (hydraulic pressure in
   the confining oil), pore pressure, temperature, and the injected flow
   rate. Each experiment consists of two phases; a loading phase where
   stress-strain dependencies are investigated (approximately 2 days), and
   a creep phase that lasts for 150-160 days. During creep, the axial
   deformation was logged, and the effluent samples were collected for ion
   chromatography analyses. Any difference between the injected and
   produced water chemistry gives insight into the rock-fluid interactions
   that occur during flow through the core. The observed effluent
   concentration shows a reduction in Mg2+, while the Ca2+ concentration is
   increased. This, together with SEM-EDS analysis, indicates that
   magnesium-bearing mineral phases are precipitated leading to dissolution
   of calcite. This is in-line with other flow-through experiments reported
   earlier. The observed dissolution and precipitation are sensitive to the
   effective stress and test temperature. Higher stress and temperature
   lead to increased Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentration changes. The observed
   strain can be partitioned additively into a mechanical and chemical
   driven component.},

Title = {Late Pleistocene Alberca de Guadalupe maar volcano (Zacapu basin,
   Michoacan): Stratigraphy, tectonic setting, and paleo-hydrogeological
   environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {304},
Pages = {214-236},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The Late Pleistocene (similar to 21,000 yr BP) Alberca de Guadalupe maar
   is one of the few phreatomagmatic volcanoes occurring within the
   scoria-cone dominated Plio-Quaternary Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic
   Field. The scarcity of this type of volcano implies that conditions
   favoring their formation are rarely met in this region. We identify
   these factors by implementing current methods of investigation with
   emphasis on hydrogeological conditions. We present the stratigraphy
   (including a set of Ar-40/Ar-39 and C-14 dates) of the SE margin of the
   Zacapu intermontane tectonic basin, where the maar just forms a hole
   (similar to 1 km in diameter, similar to 150 m deep, bearing a similar
   to 9 m deep lake) in the otherwise planar topography of the underlying
   early Pleistocene lava flows of the Cerro Pelon scoria cone. The maar is
   composed of typical phreatomagmatic surge deposits that are poorly
   sorted and rich in accidental lithics (>60 wt.\% of the deposit) with
   few juveniles (basaltic andesite, SiO2 = 54-58 wt.\%). The entire
   structure is cut by an ENE-WSW trending normal fault and is underlain by
   andesite lavas and silicic ignimbrites (partly inferred from xenoliths
   encountered in the maar deposits) that are Miocene to Early Pleistocene
   in age. The crater is at the center of a N-S elongated drainage basin
   surrounded by topographic highlands that channel water with high
   hydraulic pressure from most directions towards the location of the mar.
   This geometric configuration was already in existence at the time of the
   maar-forming eruption, but the climate was different. Colder and more
   humid conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (Cw2-climate type,
   annual precipitation of >1000 mm) favored the saturation of the
   fractured shallow aquifer system (hydraulic conductivity of 10(-8) to
   10(-7) m/s) that supplied sufficient groundwater at a high flow rate
   directed towards the center of the basin. Upon contact near surface
   (<200 m) with the rising dike of basaltic andesite magma, the continuous
   supply of both dike-fed basaltic andesite magma and groundwater at an
   optimal ratio of 0.2 allowed explosive interaction for the entire
   duration of the eruption (17-57 days) creating a >150 m deep crater with
   steep inner walls and an underlying shallow diatreme (<300 m). Since
   then, partial collapse of the walls along listric ring-fractures has
   reduced crater steepness. The present climate is much drier (Cw1 climate
   conditions with annual precipitation of 697.5-874.8 mm) and it seems
   unlikely that a maar would form if these conditions persist.
   Nonetheless, precipitation is still high enough to sustain a similar to
   9-m-deep lake in the crater with insignificant seasonal water table
   fluctuations. These findings lend further support to the notion that
   maars can be used as paleoclimate indicators in central Mexico. (C) 2015

Abstract = {The alteration of minerals and temporal evolution of solution in
   reactive flow through granitic rock fractures were investigated. Two
   experiments at different flow rates of solutions (i.e., Reynolds numbers
   for the flow) were performed on granitic rock fractures with comparable
   hydraulic apertures. The fracture surface morphologies and masses of the
   fracture walls were measured before and after the experiments. The
   alteration of the minerals on fracture surfaces exhibited nonuniform
   features induced by heterogeneity in the soluble minerals and their
   nonuniform distribution on the rock fracture surfaces. The ion
   concentrations and pH values of the solutions were measured during the
   experiments. The variations of the ion concentrations in the solutions
   were complementary to the dissolution or precipitation of minerals on
   the fracture surfaces. The water-rock reaction was identified as the
   primary process dominating the reactive flow in the experiments.
   According to the principles of mass and charge conservation, thirteen
   chemical reactions were identified between the minerals on the fracture
   surfaces and solutions in the experiments and 3 out of the thirteen
   contributed more than 90\% of the reactants in amount of substance. The
   dissolution rate of sphene for the experiment at Reynolds number 676 was
   higher than that at 3750 because of the higher reaction rate between the
   solutions and the rock minerals. A correction coefficient was introduced
   and calculated to describe the effect of flow rate on the reaction rate.},

Title = {Characteristics of Suspended Sediment Loadings under Asian Summer
   Monsoon Climate Using the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN},

Abstract = {The extreme variation in the amount of annual precipitation and rainfall
   during single events is typical of the East Asian monsoon climate and
   may greatly influence the characteristics of the suspended sediment
   load. The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest
   multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality
   problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and
   it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the
   result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during
   the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended
   sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was
   investigated by comparing the variation of yearly suspended sediment
   loads and the ratio of maximum suspended sediment loads in a single
   event to yearly suspended sediment load from Lake Imha watershed using
   the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration
   is performed according to the 2009-2010 events, and simulation results
   characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon
   climate for 2001-2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were
   performed every 4-6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly
   simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good
   agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended
   sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high
   variance of the yearly suspended sediment load and a significant of
   amount of suspended sediment load during a single event influenced by
   the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly suspended sediment load was 10
   times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly
   suspended sediment load was loaded with a single event under the Asian
   summer monsoon climate and the ratio of suspended sediment loads by a
   single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29\% to 90\%. Structural
   best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in
   stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more
   storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion
   by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas,
   which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region.},

Title = {Death time estimation of water heritages in Gonabad Plain, Iran},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {A Qanat is a hydraulic structure for the extraction of the groundwater
   using only gravity force without need to apply external force through
   pumping. The deepest and oldest Qanats in the world are located in the
   Gonabad Plain in the Razavi Khorasan Province, east of Iran. Qanats have
   been the most important approach for groundwater extraction and survive
   in arid region such as the study area for thousands of years, but they
   are disappearing because of climate and human factors. In the present
   research, descending trends of flow rate of four historical Qanats
   (i.e., Rahn, Baidokht, Kheshuie and Qasabeh) of the Gonabad Plain have
   been studied and analyzed using discharge values of the Qanats over the
   last 33 years. Effective factors on discharge values of these Qanats
   have also been discussed. The analysis indicated that the amount of
   precipitation in the study area and its mountains has decreased
   significantly since 2000. Moreover, because of drinking demand and
   traditional agriculture consumptions, the amount of annual groundwater
   extraction through deep wells has increased since 1960 and its amount
   reached 12 million cubic meters. As the groundwater drawdown increases,
   the water-bearing zone of the Qanats will decrease and the Qanats will
   dry gradually. The annual groundwater level drawdown in the Gonabad
   Plain is 0.1 m per year. The discharges of the different Qanats in the
   Gonabad Plain have been dropped from 38 to 9 L/s during the last 33
   years. The results indicated that the discharge reduction of the Qanats
   is 4-14 L/s due to one meter groundwater level drawdown. As the
   groundwater drawdown continues with the current rate in the Gonabad
   Plain, these valuable water heritages will perish over 9-157 next years
   for the aforementioned Qanats. To prevent the destruction of the Qanats,
   it is suggested to reduce 7.2 MCM of groundwater extracted through wells
   by optimal use of water and prevent the development of agriculture and
   industries that need water in the Gonabad Plain.},

Title = {A field-pilot for passive bioremediation of As-rich acid mine drainage},

Abstract = {A field-pilot bioreactor exploiting microbial iron (Fe) oxidation and
   subsequent arsenic (As) and Fe co-precipitation was monitored during 6
   months for the passive treatment of As-rich acid mine drainage (AMD). It
   was implemented at the Carnoules mining site (southern France) where AMD
   contained 790-1315 mg L-1 Fe(II) and 84-152 mg L-1 As, mainly as As(Ill)
   (78-83\%). The bioreactor consisted in five shallow trays of 1.5 m(2) in
   series, continuously fed with AMD by natural flow. We monitored the flow
   rate and the water physico-chemistry including redox Fe and As
   speciation. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was calculated and the
   precipitates formed inside the bioreactor were characterized
   (mineralogy, Fe and As content, As redox state). Since As(III) oxidation
   improves As retention onto Fe minerals, bacteria with the capacity to
   oxidize As(III) were quantified through their marker gene aioA. Arsenic
   removal yields in the pilot ranged between 3\% and 97\% (average rate
   (1.8 +/- 0.8) X 10(-8) mol L-1 s(-1)), and were positively correlated to
   HRT and inlet water dissolved oxygen concentration. Fe removal yields
   did not exceed 11\% (average rate (7 +/- 5) X 10(-8) mol L-1 s(-1)). In
   the first 32 days the precipitate contained tooeleite, a rare arsenite
   ferric sulfate mineral. Then, it evolved toward an amorphous ferric
   arsenate phase. The As/Fe molar ratio and As(V) to total As proportion
   increased from 0.29 to 0.86 and from similar to 20\% to 99\%,
   respectively. The number of bacterial aioA gene copies increased
   ten-fold during the first 48 days and stabilized thereafter. These
   results and the monitoring of arsenic speciation in the inlet and the
   outlet water, provide evidences that As(III) oxidized in the pilot. The
   biotreatment system we designed proved to be suitable for high As DMA.
   The formation of sludge highly enriched into As(V) rather than As(III)
   is advantageous in the perspective of long term storage.},

Title = {Reliability check of flash-flood in Central Bohemia on May 25, 1872},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The flash flood occurring on May 25, 1872 ranks among the most extreme
   events recorded within the Czech Republic. The causative torrential rain
   affected mostly the area between Karlovy Vary, Plzen and Prague of
   approximately 2000 km(2). A corresponding intensity of precipitation
   observed incidentally at two sites exceeded 200 mm in 3-8 h. The
   consequent flood caused tremendous damages to ponds, houses, and
   infrastructure and resulted in a temporary collapse of transport
   especially due to a total break of trains operation. The flood led to
   approximately 240-300 fatalities according to various sources. An extent
   of the total area affected reached approximately 2000-3000 km(2)
   representing an unusually large scale for such a type of flood. The
   intensive rain and inflow caused the biggest rupture of a water
   reservoir in Mladotice so far. The respective Mladoticky pond held very
   likely 3-4 million cubic meters of water before its rupture. With a
   delay of 2 to 3 days, a substantial saturation triggered a massive
   landslide blocking the Mladoticky7 water stream and creating a new water
   body named the Odlezelske Lake.
   The flood event motivated elaboration of at least 3 scholarly papers
   already between 1872 and 1875. Accordingly, this flood presents for
   Czech hydrologists an outstanding example of such an extreme magnitude
   until now. The flood in 1872 and drought in 1874 led directly to
   establishing the Hydrological service of the Czech Kingdoms in 1875.
   Hitherto, we have no comparison for such extreme flood including recent
   floods occurring in 2002, 2010 and 2013. The flood peaks exceeded other
   historical or recent floods by at least 1-2 m. There is only one similar
   flood event, the flood of July 31, 1714 at the Skava River catchment.
   As there were no regular hydrological observations including
   precipitation measurements available for the affected areas before 1883,
   the prevailing data source comprise documentary sources and their
   relevant interpretations. The aim of our study is to explain in a more
   detail the course of this flood and a number of indeterminate
   circumstances during the flood. An important question was an effect of
   the collapse of approximately 100 ponds and a role of the collapsed
   sizeable Mladoticky pond. These phenomena were partly explained by
   newspapers and chronicles describing an incredibly rapid increase of
   water level (2-3 m in a few minutes) at a relatively large number of
   sites. We have completed a hydraulic estimation of peak discharges at
   major profiles. In our research we used the Aqualog hydrological
   modelling system. The hydrological modelling enabled us to complete and
   check the reliability of observed causative precipitation for the
   affected area and peak flow rates at the Beroun and Prague
   municipalities. An important point was the reconstruction of a flow
   hydrograph at Prague with very intricate shape and two likely local
   peaks. Second local maximum could be attributed to the collapse of the
   Mladoticky pond. This flood is of crucial importance for the Prague
   flood protection system. The main reason being a short time span of 22 h
   between the beginning of causative rainfall and occurrence of maximum
   flood flow rate at Prague.},

Title = {Combination of aquifer thermal energy storage and enhanced
   bioremediation: Biological and chemical clogging},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {613},
Pages = {707-713},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Interest in the combination concept of aquifer thermal energy storage
   (ATES) and enhanced bioremediation has recently risen due to the demand
   for both renewable energy technology and sustainable ground water
   management in urban areas. However, the impact of enhanced
   bioremediation on ATES is not yet clear. Of main concern is the
   potential for biological clogging which might be enhanced and hamper the
   proper functioning of ATES. On the other hand, more reduced conditions
   in the subsurface by enhanced bioremediation might lower the chance of
   chemical clogging, which is normally caused by Fe(III) precipitate. To
   investigate the possible effects of enhanced bioremediation on clogging
   with ATES, we conducted two recirculating column experiments with
   differing flow rates (10 and 50 mL/min), where enhanced biological
   activity and chemically promoted Fe(III) precipitation were studied by
   addition of lactate and nitrate respectively. The pressure drop between
   the influent and effluent side of the column was used as a measure of
   the (change in) hydraulic conductivity, as indication of clogging in
   these model ATES systems. The results showed no increase in upstream
   pressure during the period of enhanced biological activity (after
   lactate addition) under both flow rates, while the addition of nitrate
   lead to significant buildup of the pressure drop. However, at the flow
   rate of 10 mL/min, high pressure buildup caused by nitrate addition
   could be alleviated by lactate addition. This indicates that the risk of
   biological clogging is relatively small in the investigated areas of the
   mimicked ATES system that combines enhanced bioremediation with lactate
   as substrate, and furthermore that lactate may counter chemical
   clogging. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modelling recovery of ammonium from urine by electro-concentration in a
   3-chamber cell},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {210-218},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Electro-concentration enables treatment and nutrient recovery from
   source-separated urine, and is a potential technology for on-site
   treatment using a 3 compartment configuration that has anode, cathode
   and middle concentrate compartments. There is a particular focus on
   driving concentration towards the precipitation threshold in the
   concentrate compartment to generate solid ammonium salts, including
   ammonium bicarbonate. To evaluate controlling mechanisms and the
   feasibility of achieving high concentrations, a dynamic mechanistic
   model was developed and validated using experiments with synthetic
   urine. It was identified that high concentrations are prevented by
   increased back diffusion (diffusion from the middle chamber to the
   anolyte and catholyte) due to large concentration gradients, and the
   preferential migration of protons or hydroxide ions due to a loss of
   buffering capacity in the anolyte and catholyte (due to pH extremes).
   Model-based sensitivity analysis also identified that electrolyte ion
   concentrations (including buffer capacity) were the main controlling
   mechanisms, rather than membrane or electrolyte current transfer
   capacity. To attain high concentrations, operation should be done using
   a) a high current density (however there is a maximum efficient current
   density); b) feed at short hydraulic retention time to ensure sufficient
   buffer capacity; and c) a feed high in ammonium and carbonate, not
   diluted, and not contaminated with other salts, such as pure ureolysed
   urine. Taking into account electron supply and bio-anodic buffer
   limitations, model testing shows at least double the aqueous
   concentrations observed in the experiments may be achieved by optimising
   simple process and operational parameters such as flow rate, current
   density and feed solution composition. Removal of total ammonium
   nitrogen (TAN) and total carbonate carbon (TCC) was between 43-57\% and
   39-53\%, respectively. Balancing the sometimes conflicting process goals
   of high concentrations and removal percentage will need to be considered
   in further application. Future experimental work should be directed
   towards developing electrodes capable of higher current densities. In
   addition it would be desirable to use ion exchange membranes with higher
   resistance to water fluxes and which limit back diffusion. Future
   modelling work should describe osmotic and electro-osmotic water fluxes
   as a function of the concentration gradient across the membranes and
   ionic fluxes, respectively. More generalised wastewater
   physico-chemistry speciation models should identify best methods where
   relatively simple Davies activity corrections do not apply. (C) 2017
