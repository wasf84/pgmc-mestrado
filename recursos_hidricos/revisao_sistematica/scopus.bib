abstract={Denitrifying bioreactors are a conservation drainage practice for reducing nitrate loads in subsurface agricultural drainage. Bioreactor hydraulic capacity is limited by cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow through the woodchip bed, with excess bypass flow untreated. Paired bioreactors with wide orientations were built in 2017 in Illinois, USA, to treat drainage from a relatively large 29 ha field. The paired design consisted of: a larger, Main bioreactor (LWD: 6.1 × 18.3 × 0.9 m) for treating base flow, and 2) a smaller, Booster bioreactor (7.8 × 13.1 × 0.9 m) receiving bypass flow from the Main bioreactor during periods of high flow. Over three years of monitoring, the paired bioreactor captured 84–92% of the annual drainage discharge which demonstrated an expanded cross-sectional area could improve bioreactor flow capture, even for a large drainage area. However, the paired bioreactors removed 6–28% of the annual N load leaving the field (1.8–5.6 kg N ha−1 removed; 52–161 kg N), which was not a notable improvement compared to bioreactors treating smaller drainage areas. The design operated as intended at low annual flow-weighted hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of usually ≤2 h, but these short HRTs ultimately limited bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency. Daily HRTs of &lt;2 h often resulted in nitrate flushing. The Main bioreactor had higher hydraulic loading as intended and was responsible for the majority of flow captured in each year although not always the most nitrate mass removal. The Booster bioreactor provided better nitrate removal than the Main at HRTs of 3.0–11.9 h, possibly due to its drying cycles which may have liberated more available carbon. This new design approach tested at the field-scale illustrated tradeoffs between greater flow capacity (via increased bioreactor width) and longer HRT (via increased length), given a consistent bioreactor surface footprint. © 2022 The Author(s)},

funding_text 3={Relatively low nitrate concentration reductions due to a shortened bioreactor may be an acceptable tradeoff if the increased flow capacity, and thus increased nitrate loading, results in increased nitrate mass removed. Most subsurface drainage bioreactors in the US have had length: width (L:W) ratios of 2.0–12.5 to achieve sufficient HRT and uniform plug flow (Christianson et al., 2012a; David et al., 2016; Jones and Kult, 2016; Rosen and Christianson, 2017). The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Conservation Practice Standard for denitrifying bioreactors recommends use of more complicated multi-header flow distributors when L:W < 4 (USDA NRCS, 2020), so most bioreactors built with federal funding assistance have L:W ≥ 4 to simplify design and construction.This approach was not without limitations in that overall edge-of-field nitrate removal efficiency was not notably improved from conventional bioreactors that have L:W > 2 (and are typically on smaller drainage areas). Such conventionally-designed bioreactors provide greater bioreactor nitrate removal efficiency due to longer HRTs, and this was an expected trade-off. However, these data newly showed an additional tradeoff at low HRTs where nitrate was flushed from the reactors at HRTs <2 h. Altogether, this study (1) documented an expanded cross-sectional area resulted in excellent flow captured, even for a large drainage area and (2) supported the concept of a minimum HRT design criterion.This work was primarily funded by the Illinois Nutrient Research and Education Council (IL NREC; Project #2017-4-360498-302.

abstract={Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is proposed to be a point source of microplastics (MPs) that enter aquatic environments. Here, we quantified and characterized MPs down to 20 µm at a tertiary WWTP in Korea over a 1-year period. All wastewater contained MPs during the monitoring period, with concentrations ranging from 114 ± 17–216 ± 65 particles/L for influent and from 0.26 ± 0.29–0.48 ± 0.11 particles/L for effluent. MP abundance in the influents showed significant seasonal differences whereas a seasonal trend was not observed for the effluents, indicating a stable treatment performance (approx. 99.8%) of the WWTP. Spatial surveys of MP distribution in the WWTP showed that most MPs were removed by coagulation-sedimentation and rapid sand filtration, but some MPs still remained in the final effluent to generate the potential annual load of 2.9 × 109 particles and 0.54 kg into the rivers. These findings highlight the importance of long-term monitoring and MP mass quantification that would promote more accurate estimation of the MP load from WWTPs. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) method was applied to investigate the impacts of climate change on the water quantity and quality of the Qu’Appelle River in Saskatchewan, Canada. First, the second-generation Canadian earth system model (CanESM2) was adopted to predict future climate conditions. The Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) was then applied to downscale the generated data. To analyze the water quality of the river, concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total dissolved solids (TDSs) from the river were collected. Using the collected climate and hydrometric data, the ANNs were trained to simulate (i) the ratio of snowfall-to-total precipitation based on the temperature, (ii) the river flow rate based on the temperature and precipitation; and (iii) DO and TDS concentrations based on the river flow and temperature. Finally, the generated climate change data were used as inputs to the ANN model to investigate the climate change impacts on the river flow as well as DO and TDS concentrations within the selected region. Hydrologic alteration of the river was evaluated via the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) under historical and climate change scenarios. The results under climate change scenarios were compared with those under historical scenarios and indicated that climate change would lead to a heterogeneous change in precipitation and temperature patterns. These changes would have serious degrading impacts on the river discharge as well as DO and TDS concentration levels, causing deterioration in the sustainability of the river system and ecological health of the region. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={Flood damage assessment is becoming now more important because of flooding disasters around the world. Severe rainstorms are common occurrences in some regions of Saudi Arabia that result in hazardous floods damaging the infrastructure and development plans. This study is applied in order to assess the flood hazards in the study area and to propose some countermeasures to reduce the flood damage. In recent years, Riyadh has experienced several flooding events that caused damages in and around the city in different locations due to the change in climate and land use. The paper presents a framework for a study of flood damage assessment of vulnerable area in Riyadh that was exposed to severe damages occurred by flash floods. As well as, conducting analyzes of morphology, metrology, hydrological and hydraulic analysis are included. Then, proposing a plan to mitigate the damages happened to the study area. The prediction of rainfall depths for 50 and 100-y were estimated using the frequency analysis to be 46.5.6 and 52.2 mm, respectively. The peak flow rates at the catchment outlet for 50-and 100-y return periods were estimated to be 256.0 and 291.0 m3/s, respectively. The weighted Curve Number value of Wadi basin was estimated to be 81. In the hydraulic modelling, the Manning roughness coefficient was increased to 0.03 to dissipate the energy at the baffles and drops. The scour depths at the bridge piers were estimated assuming that the valley cross section does not tolerate the high water velocities. The study recommended taking into account the expected scour depth which obtained from the hydraulic modelling and the Wadi bed condition to guide the designer to use deep foundations at the piers of the bridge to overcome and alleviate from the flash flood impact. © 2022 Desalination Publications.

abstract={The development of compact treatment devices with high removal efficiencies and low space requirements is a key objective of urban stormwater treatment. Thus, many devices utilize a combination of sedimentation and upward flow filtration in a single system. This study, for the first time, evaluates the flow field inside a combined filter-lamella separator via computational fluid dynamics. Herein, three objectives are investigated: (i) the flow field for different structural configurations, (ii) the distribution of particulate matter along the filter bed and (iii) the dynamic clogging in discrete filter zones, which is addressed by a clogging model derived from literature data. The results indicate that a direct combination of a filtration stage with a lamella separator promotes a uniform flow distribution. The distribution of particulate matter along the filter bed varies with configuration and particle size. Clogging, induced by particles in the spectrum <63 μm, creates gradients of hydraulic conductivity along the filter bed. After treating about half of Germany's annual runoff-efficient precipitation at a rainfall intensity of 5 L/(s·ha), the filtration rates increase in the front of the filter bed by +10%. Thus, long-term operating behavior is sensitive to efficient filter utilization in compact treatment devices. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={A non-stationary increasing streamflow trend has been observed on the Mississippi River and other major river basins around the world. The current study analyzed the non-stationary streamflow effects (NSFEs) on flood management in backwater areas adjacent to the Atchafalaya Basin floodway in Louisiana, USA. A continuous simulation hydrology model coupled with a quasi-two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the basin floodway and surrounding regions was used to develop over 180 simulation scenarios by superimposing local flood events (early summer 2014 and late summer 2016) against 90-years’ worth of daily Atchafalaya River streamflow hydrographs. The NSFE on the Atchafalaya River induced substantial reductions in the performance of major flood regulating structures with seasonal effects based on the annual flood cycle. Capacity reductions at the structures were demonstrated to trigger a cascade of effects in ostensibly protected backwater areas including amplification of erosion potential near the levee and within tidal passes during early summer floods. Increases in mean and peak flood levels on the order of 15–20 cm during local storm events were shown to extend as far as 20 km away from the floodway protection levee during both early and late summer local flooding scenarios. Low-lying areas closest to the levee were adversely affected during both the high (early summer) and low flow (late summer) periods of the annual discharge cycle. The approach and findings of this study are relevant for risk management in river basins around the world affected by NSFEs. © 2022 The Author},

abstract={Large lakes are key components of hydrological processes and have critical ecological and economic functions. Streamflow and riverine sediment loads exported from tributary rivers to lakes provide inputs of water and nutrients and greatly impact the health of lacustrine ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of water and sediment transport dynamics within the basins of large lakes is therefore required for informed management of their resources. In particular, the hydrological processes of large lake basins in western China were not fully explored yet. This study investigated changes in runoff and sediment fluxes entering the two largest lakes in China (Qinghai Lake and Poyang Lake) over the past half century. Our results showed that the regional trends of the two lake basins have changed in divergent way. The patterns of change of streamflow and sediment transport—including the trends, periodicity, and transition points as well as the relationship between streamflow and sediment flux—were quite different. The results obtained by a Sediment Identity method revealed that increases of the precipitation and runoff coefficient controlled the observed increase of streamflow and sediment flux within the Qinghai Lake basin, whereas the decrease of the sediment flux entering Poyang Lake was caused mainly by a reduction in sediment concentration. Climate change was the dominant driver influencing the recent increases in surface water resources and sediment load in the Qinghai Lake basin as well as the long-term fluctuations of streamflow within the Poyang Lake basin. In contrast, the observed abrupt reduction in total sediment flux entering Poyang Lake was due mainly to declining sediment discharge from the Gan River; this decrease is attributed primarily to human activities, especially reservoir construction and soil conservation practices. Overall, this study discovers the divergent change patterns when investigating hydrological processes, and highlights the importance of developing policies for managing soil and water resources within large lake basins to the northwest and southeast of the Hu Line. Management policies should consider the tremendous differences in geography, climate, and population across China. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In order to reveal the effect of thermal hydraulic conditions on the PWR CIPS risk, the evaluation of a PWR CIPS risk in the first cycle under different core flow rates, average primary temperatures, power levels, and primary pressures was conducted by combining thermal hydraulic codes LINDEN and CRUD (Chalk River unidentified deposit) analysis software CAMPSIS. The research result illustrating the essential effect of thermal hydraulic conditions on CIPS is changing the SNB (subcooled nucleate boiling) level of the fuel assembly’s surface; thus, boron precipitation and local power distribution will be affected. Theoretical evidence and statistical support of the effect of thermal hydraulic conditions on the PWR CIPS risk could be obtained via this research. Copyright © 2022 Meng, Yan, Hu, Hu and Ruan.},

abstract={An in-depth understanding of the rainfall-runoff process is essential for effective stormwater management. However, the understanding of the hierarchy of rainfall characteristics in terms of their importance in influencing runoff generation is limited. This paper investigates the influence of rainfall characteristics and catchment characteristics on runoff generation in urban catchments. The outcomes showed that there are 4 dominant factors affecting runoff generation: total precipitation TP and maximum 60-min rainfall intensity MAX60 are the two top-ranked factors while average rainfall intensity RI and maximum 5-min rainfall intensity MAX5 are ranked second. Additionally, compared to the moderate rainfall regime (MR), the heavy rainfall regime (HR) tends to produce higher peak flow rates, higher total inflow per unit area, and lower runoff control effect. Note that the antecedent precipitation has a more significant effect on runoff generation and is even the dominant factor when rainstorm events with daily rainfall larger than 50 mm are not considered. The results of analyzing the influence of catchment characteristics suggest that only under HR regime conditions do the catchment characteristics have an impact on runoff generation and behave as smaller catchment areas, and higher proportions of green landscapes always lead lower peak flow rates, lower total inflows per unit area, and higher runoff control effects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={We used the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as a framework to develop an empirical Hg flux model for Upper East Fork Poplar Creek (UEFPC), a Hg-contaminated watershed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By integrating long-term Hg monitoring data with simulated flow and suspended solid loads in a site-specific empirical Hg transport model, we (1) quantified the spatial, temporal, and flow regime controls on daily Hg flux (adjusted R2 = 0.82) and (2) made predictions about Hg flux under future climate, land use, and management scenarios. We found that 62.79% of the average daily Hg flux in the watershed is currently driven by base flow, whereas variability in Hg flux is driven by storm and extreme flow. We estimate an average annual Hg flux of 28.82 g day-1 leaving the watershed under baseline precipitation, with an estimated 43.73% reduction in daily Hg flux under drought conditions and a 296% increase in daily Hg flux in extreme precipitation scenarios. We estimated that a new mercury treatment facility would result in a 24.7% reduction in Hg flux under baseline conditions and a 33.4% reduction under extreme precipitation scenarios. The study demonstrated the merit of this approach, which can be replicated for sites where information on flow, suspended solids, and Hg concentrations is available. © 2021},

abstract={Human urine can be used as a fertilizer, however, due to the high water content (97%), concentration is required to make transportation economically feasible. Reverse osmosis (RO) has been identified as an energy efficient concentration method. Furthermore, to maximize nitrogen recovery from source-separated urine it should be stabilized with an acid or base to prevent urea hydrolysis. However, the method of stabilization will have an impact on the downstream RO process. Calcium hydroxide is often used as a base stabilization method for human urine but would require pre-treatment to remove excess calcium and subsequent membrane scaling. Three pre-treatment methods such as air bubbling, NaHCO3 addition, and NH4HCO3 addition, were investigated in this study. Each method successfully reduced the scaling potential and air bubbling was determined to be the most effective method as it resulted in the highest nutrient recovery during concentration and did not require the addition of any chemicals. Base stabilization with air bubbling pre-treatment was then compared to urine stabilized with citric acid. Acid stabilized urine had a higher nitrogen recovery (7.6% higher). However, solids formed in the real acidified urine and during concentration a brown organic compound formed on the membrane surface. The crystals were identified as uric acid dihydrate and the brown organic fouling resulted in a significant decrease in permeate flux as compared to the base stabilized urine with air bubbling pre-treatment. At a 60% water recovery, 85.5% of the urea and 99.2% of the potassium was recovered in the brine stream and more than 99.9% of the phosphorus was recovered as a separate solid calcium phosphate fertilizer. Whilst nutrient recovery was higher with acid stabilization, the membrane fouling that occurred with this stabilization method meant that base stabilization with air bubbling pre-treatment was the preferred treatment option. It is recommended that acid stabilized urine be concentrated using evaporation processes instead. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, we report the use of nanobubbles (NBs) as a simple and facile approach to effectively delay scaling in membrane distillation (MD) during the treatment of highly saline feed (100 g L−1). Unlike conventional gas bubbling in MD for improving the hydrodynamic flow conditions in the feed channel, here we generated air NBs with an average size of 128.81 nm in the feed stream and examined their impact on membrane scaling inhibition during MD operation. Due to their small size, neutral buoyancy, and negative surface charge, NBs remain in suspension for a longer time (14 days), providing homogenous mixing throughout the entire feed water. The MD performance results revealed that severe membrane scaling happened during the DCMD treatment of high salinity brine in the absence of nanobubbles, which dramatically reduced the distillate flux to zero after 13 h. A one-time addition of air NBs in the saline feed significantly reduced salt precipitation and crystal deposition on the PVDF membrane surface, delayed the occurrence of flux decline, prevented membrane wetting, thereby prolonging the effective MD operating time. With similar feed concentration and operating conditions, only 63% flux decline after 98 h operation was recorded in nanobubble-assisted MD. Two key explanations were suggested for the delayed membrane scaling upon addition of air NBs in the MD feed: (1) NB-induced turbulent flow in the feed channel that increases the surface shear forces at the membrane surface, alleviating both temperature and concentration polarization effect, (2) electrostatic attractions of the counterions to the negatively charged NBs, which reduces the availability of these ions in the bulk feed for scale formation. © 2021},

abstract={The velocity of overland flow is one of the important parameters to simulate the hydrological processes and soil erosion on sloping farmlands. In this study, a solute centroid model was selected to determine the velocity distribution, according to the salt transport of overland flow, in order to clarify the erosion mechanism on the straw mulching slope under extreme rainfall. A systematic experiment was conducted under an artificial rainfall intensity of 160 mm/h at the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Agriculture on the Loess Plateau. The velocity measurements were performed at the slope lengths of 1.15, 3.15, 4.15, and 5.15 m under the slope gradients of 5°,10°, and 20°, and the mulching rate of 2, 4 and 8 t/hm2. The experimental soil flume was in the size of 0.25 m wide, 8 m long, and 0.3 m deep, which was filled with the clay loam that composed of 31.8% clay, 43.3% silt, and 24.8% sand, and sampled from Yangling, China (34°16'50″ N, 108°3'13″E). The wheat straw was air-dried and chopped to 5-7 cm before being laid over the surface soil. A downspout rain simulator was also selected, where the rainfall uniformity was 85%, and the rainfall height was 18 m. A flow velocity was determined using an electrolyte centroid. After that, some hydraulic parameters were calculated, including the unit width discharge, water depth, Reynolds coefficient, Froude number, and Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient. The measurements showed that the mean velocity was ranged in 0.071-0.352 and 0.017-0.117 m/s at the mulching rate of 0 and 8 t/hm2, respectively. There was a smooth curve of electrolyte transport under the condition of low straw coverage rate (2 t/hm2), whereas, no smooth curve without the straw mulching treatment. The smoothness of electrolyte transport under the 100% straw coverage was between those of no and low straw coverage. The straw mulching greatly weakened the disturbance of raindrops on the overland flow, but increased the roughness of the eroded underlying surface, leading to a lower average flow velocity. Once the mulching rate reached a critical point, there was an intensive disturbance of mulching straw on the overland flow. The distance to the maximum velocity of overland flow on the slopes with a high mulching rate was much shorter than that with a low mulching rate. In addition, the mean flow velocity was ranged in 0.017-0.352, 0.027-0.323, and 0.033-0.272 m/s under the slope gradients of 5°, 10°, and 20°, respectively. The flow velocity increased significantly, with the increase of slope gradient and length. But the change rate of flow velocity decreased, with the increase in the slope length, until the velocity gradually tended to be stable. There was a strong linear relationship of flow velocities between the straw mulching and bare slope, where the proportional coefficient was 0.285. The flow regime of overland flow depended mainly on the mulching straw and the critical value of Reynolds number, which was less than 500 in the laminar flow. Once the overland flow was stable, the flow rate and velocity of overland flow were stable without changes with time. The water depth of the bare soil slope varied from 0.8 to 1.4 mm, whereas, the water depth of the covered slope varied from 2.0 to 5.1 mm. Consequently, the straw mulch can be widely expected to obstruct the water flow, further reducing the flow velocity for the low water level, compared with the bare soil slope. The disturbance effect of straw mulch on the water flow was also strengthened in the downstream section of the slope, with the increase of catchment areas. The finding can greatly contribute to clarifying the effects of soil erosion on the straw-mulched slope under the conditions of extreme rainfall. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={Key message: The rate of vessel tapering is highly conserved across a precipitation gradient in tropical trees, pointing to a limit on tree height determined by a maximum basal vessel diameter. Maximum tree height in the tropics decreases strongly with decreasing precipitation. The role of hydraulic architecture in controlling this variation in tree height remains unclear. The widening of conducting xylem vessels from the apex to the base of trees, also known as tapering, is important for maintaining the hydraulic conductivity along the tree stem. If in contrast vessel diameter were constant, then resistance would increase with path length constraining flow rates as tree height increases. Whilst previous research has shown that vessel diameter scales with tree height at a similar rate (similar power law exponent) across biomes and taxa, knowledge on these relationships across precipitation gradients within a single species is incomplete, especially for the tropics. Here we report how vessel density and diameter at the tree base differ for two tropical Cedrela species across four sites varying in precipitation from 1014 to 2585 mm year−1. We find that maximum tree height decreases with decreasing precipitation across sites from 42 to 13 m. Despite the strong differences between sites in maximum tree height and water availability, tapering is indeed remarkably conserved and close to published scaling with height based on multi-species analyses. Thus, for a given tree height, basal vessel diameter does not vary between sites, whilst the maximum basal vessel size is two times smaller at the drier site (with the shortest trees) compared to the wettest site (with the tallest trees). This suggests a possible limitation of tree height determined by a maximum basal vessel diameter that can be sustained, given increasing embolism risk with increasing dryness. Our results show no hydraulic adaptation across this wetness gradient and reveal a clear relationship between maximum tree height and maximum basal vessel size. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Storm frequency estimates and their temporal distributions are important in determining estimates of runoff or peak flow rates in many engineering and hydrological problems. Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70 has been serving as the design rainfall standard in Illinois since its publication in 1989. Although Bulletin 70 represented the best available data at the time of its publication, the standards needed to be reevaluated and updated after more than three decades and with the growing evidence of the nonstationary nature of heavy precipitation. The trends in heavy precipitation in Illinois prompted the creation of a new frequency study named Bulletin 75, providing precipitation frequencies for event durations ranging from 5 min to 10 days and for recurrence intervals ranging from 2 months to 500 years. The results are presented for the same 10 geographic sections in Illinois as in Bulletin 70 to maintain the continuity of hydrologic studies and compatibility with regulations. The primary goal of this paper is to outline some of the key methodological issues and challenges, to compare the results with the previous sources, and to highlight the effects of the changing precipitation standards on the development of amendments to existing ordinances. Lake County in Illinois, as one of the most affected urban areas with the highest change in heavy precipitation, was selected to illustrate issues related to the application of modified precipitation standards. © 2022 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract={Human activities and climate change are two major stressors affecting lake ecosystems as well as phytoplankton communities worldwide. However, how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are directly or indirectly linked to anthropogenic activities and climatic oscillation remains unclear. We assessed the annual trends (1988–2018) in phytoplankton abundance (PA) in Lake Dongting, China and related it to five groups of variables characterizing human activities, global climate oscillation, water nutrients, hydrology, and meteorology. We found a significant increase in PA, urbanization (Upop), total nitrogen (TN), fertilizer application (FA), number of summer days (SU), and the warm speed duration index (WSDI) and a significant decrease in the water discharge of three inlets (TIWD) and the sediment discharge of three inlets (TISD) and four tributaries (FTSD) and the net sediment deposition (NSD). However, no significant annual trends were observed for the number of rainstorm days (R50mm), the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII) and yearly anomalies of El Niño-Southern oscillation events (ENSOi). Cross-correlation Function analyses demonstrated that the operation of the Three George Dam (TGD) strengthened the effects of hydrology, rainfall patterns and ENSOi on phytoplankton, but strongly weakened the association between water nutrients, human activities and phytoplankton abundance. Path analysis revealed that TP, TN, FA, R50 mm as well as WSDI had a direct positive effect on PA, while a direct negative effect was found for ENSOi, NSD and TISD. Human activities (Upop and FA), warming (WSDI and SU), and rainfall patterns (SDII and R50 mm) exerted indirect controls on phytoplankton through changes in water nutrients and hydrology. Climate change (ENSOi) had a direct effect on PA, but also showed twelve indirect pathways via changes in hydrology and meteorology (both positive and negative effects were found). Overall, meteorology contributed most markedly to the variations of PA (29.3%), followed by hydrology (25.3%), human activities (24%), water nutrients (10.5%), and ENSOi (1.9%). Our results highlight a strongly causal connection between human activities as well as global climate change and phytoplankton and the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the temporal dynamics of lake biotic communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Anabranching channel designs are seldom utilized for river restoration projects despite their potential for efficient hydraulic conveyance and robust floodplain habitat. We evaluated a stream restoration project that concentrates base flows within a single deep, narrow channel overflowing into secondary channels and an alternating series of higher elevation active benches at flood stages. The design represents an implementation of a Cluer and Thorne SEM Stage 8 anastomosing system aimed at increasing transport efficiency of water and sediment through low gradient river reaches to alleviate flooding on adjacent properties. We investigated the performance of the project’s hydraulic conveyance and the general utility of anabranching channels as a restoration alternative by assessing the distribution and magnitude of deposition and erosion response patterns. High-resolution survey indicate aggradation is not occurring within the main channel. Between summer 2016 and summer 2017, reaches experienced mean elevation decreases between 0.08 and 0.29 m indicating effective discharge rates transported dominant grain sizes. Along some reaches, bed scour was sufficient to undercut banks, producing slumps, which may affect long-term conveyance capacities. Lateral bank scour was limited to reaches exposed to daily tidal flows. Variable deposition patterns were observed within secondary channels, depending on cumulative precipitation, dominant hydrology, and channel entrance orientation. Isolated tidal flows resulted in deposition, while long duration flood flows produced intertidal floodplain scour. Within fluvially-dominated benches, uniform longitudinal deposition of fine-grained sediments was associated with low channel entrance flow rates. Higher entrance flow rates resulted in concentrated deposition of coarse-grained particles, up to 0.21 m, and a longitudinal gradient of decreasing sediment sizes and magnitude. This study builds upon previous work by providing a high-resolution assessment of a constructed anabranching channel system and confirms its suitability for efficient hydraulic conveyance within fluvial reaches of lowland rivers and provides general recommendations for future designs. © 2020 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.},

abstract={Green roofs (GRs) are considered sustainable solutions for the adaptation of urban water management to climate change. The use of GRs is particularly promising in urban environments like the Metropolitan Area of Milan, the most urbanized area in Italy. In this work, we evaluated the subsurface runoff coefficient at the event-time scale, for more than one year of observations, of 68 small-scale test beds comprising different configurations of green roofs (e.g., different vegetations, types and depths of growing media, and different slopes) installed in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. The objectives of this study are three-fold. Firstly, the controlling factors of the hydraulic have been assessed for efficiency. We calculated a mean drainage flow rate of 51%, finding that growing media play a significant role in determining the drainage flow during the spring, at the beginning of the vegetative period. During this season, water retention in fertilized beds increases significantly. At the beginning of the summer, the vegetation cover is able to significantly reduce the drainage flow, playing an even more crucial role with respect to the growing medium material. However, we found that the vegetation type (grass field and Sedum) does not play a significant role in the retention processes. Secondly, the delay of the peak flow rate was determined. We found a precipitation peak delay from 1 to 2 h, which would be sufficient to guarantee environmental benefits for urban drainage. Finally, the factors controlling the hydraulic efficiency of GRs for individual precipitation events were assessed. We found that soil moisture and cumulated precipitation are both significant factors determining the drainage flow rate. In conclusion, we point out that soil moisture is one of the main parameters characterizing GR drainage and should be further considered in future research efforts devoted to the analysis of GR performance. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={A catchment model for river basins and a hydrodynamic model were combined in order to simulate the spreading of the turbidity plume produced by sediment discharges from the Guadalquivir River basin within the Gulf of Cádiz under different meteorological conditions. The current fields provided by the hydrodynamic model and a transport-diffusion scheme based on tracking virtual particles tracking released at the river mouth have enabled us to simulate turbidity plumes that show great similarity with the plumes observed in satellite images. The most relevant results of the study show that in the absence of winds, the plume tends to spread very slowly, gradually progressing northwards; this is because of the symmetry between the filling and draining flows at the mouth of the Guadalquivir and low intensity of the tidal currents beyond the mouth. In addition, the transport of the plume towards the Strait of Gibraltar requires wind conditions with a northerly, north-westerly or westerly component. Westwards transport, however, requires winds with an easterly, southerly, or south-easterly component. The periods of heaviest rainfall in the Guadalquivir River basin coincide with winds mainly from the west; therefore, the times of maximum discharge at the mouth of the river occur when there are wind conditions that favour the transport of the matter suspended in the plume, southwards along the coast, towards the Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea. Linking the watershed catchment and hydrodynamic models has proved its suitability to predict the evolution and reaching of the sediment plumes from the Guadalquivir River discharges and the experience encourages the use of that methodology to be applied in a future prediction system for the creation and evolution of those sediment plumes. © 2021 The Authors},

funding_text 2={The catchment model SWAT was chosen to simulate the hydrology of the estuary, based on the good performance in previous studies carried out by the authors (Gomiz-Pascual et al., 2016). In addition, it is a Fortran-based open source model, actively supported by the United States Department of Agriculture. SWAT is a river basin scale model that has been in use for the past three decades, developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in large, complex watersheds. It simulates the quality and quantity of surface and ground water and predicts the environmental impact of land use, land management practices, and climate change. SWAT is a long time scale simulation model. It requires input information about weather and climate, soil properties, topography, vegetation, and land uses. The physical processes associated with the water, sediments, and nutrients are calculated and interconnected by the different modules used by SWAT and described in studies, such as Neitsch et al. (2011) and Arnold et al. (1990, 1995). Considering that the Guadalquivir estuary is a highly complex system, subject to continuous changes, all these factors must be taken into account when developing a hydrological model. In this regard, SWAT is an adaptive model that allows changes in soil types, land uses, and the shape of the river as well as recalculation of the output variables (i.e. sediment or nutrient concentration) in an easy way.We would like to thank the Regional Government of Andalusia (P11-RNM-7722 project), the Spanish Government (TRUCO project RTI2018-100865-B-C22), the SUDOE INTERREG AGUAMOD and OCASO projects for supporting this work financially.

abstract={【Background and objective】Quantity and quality are two indicators of water in a river basin and they are closely correlated. In general, a change in water quantity leads to a change in water quality, and the objective of this paper is to study their relationship in water at Tai'an section of the Dawen River Basin.【Method】Water quality data measured monthly from 2010-2019 at seven stations and flow rate at one hydrology station in the section were analysed using the Kendall test to identify the rends in the changes of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). The Copula function was used to construct two-dimensional and three-dimensional joint distributions of water quantity and quality to analyse their simultaneous variation.【Result】The concentrations of COD and NH3-N had both been in decline during the studied period, with the seasonal Kendall test showing that 71% of the evaluated results showing a downward trend. Spatially, the concentrations of COD and NH3-N decreased from upstream to downstream. At Dawenkou station, the concentrations of COD and NH3-N at wet seasons was reduced by 6% and 37% respectively, and monthly water quality that reached Class IV standard was increased by 10%, compared those measured in dry seasons The two-dimensional joint distribution of water quantity and quality calculated from the Frank Copula increased as the flow rate and water quality increased. When the joint probability was the same, the concentration of COD and NH3-N decreased asymptotically as the flow rate increased. The three-dimensional joint distribution of precipitation, water quantity and quality calculated from the Clayton Copula function showed that when its value was less than 0.6, the increase in the joint probability was induced predominantly by the increase in flow rate, while when the joint probability was greater than 0.6, the impact of COD and NH3-N increased.【Conclusion】There was a close relationship between water quantity and quality at Tai'an section of the Dawen River Basin. The Copula function was able to describe the joint distribution of water quantity and quality in the section. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Irrigation and Drainage. All right reserved.},

abstract={Hydrological data and total phosphorus (TP) concentration at reservoirs’ outlet were combined in a transient complete-mix model to obtain mean input loads and inlet concentration-flow relationships. This approach was designed to investigate the issue of phosphorus pollution in semiarid regions with intermittent rivers. The methodology was applied for twenty reservoirs in the State of Ceará, Brazilian semiarid. The modeled TP loads correlated well (R2 = 0.74) with reference loads estimated from environmental inventories, with only 10% of underestimated results. The average input loads per unit area of the catchments ranged from about 4 to 40 kg km−2 yr−1, which were considerably lower than the national average of about 500 kg km−2 yr−1. This was attributed to lower precipitation indexes, intermittent river regime and a high-density reservoir network, peculiar of the Brazilian semiarid. Meanwhile, the input load per unit area of a small and highly populated urban catchment, with higher precipitation indexes and deficient sanitation was substantially higher (2626 kg km−2 yr−1). Moreover, the fitted TP concentration-flow relationships directly reflected different TP input sources: strong u-shaped behavior marked the curves of highly non-point source dominated catchments, whereas a dilution pattern prevailed in those with significant point source inputs. The model validation with measured riverine TP concentration reached a NSE of 0.63. However, peak values in TP concentration during low flow rates sensitively affected the fitting of the models. In spite of non-point source dominance in the catchments, some relationships presented a slight signal of this use type. The variation range of the fitting parameters in comparison with other studies, as well the expected behavior of the curves in light of land use characteristics, strongly support the methodology applied in this study. The proposed approach will potentially help address the TP issue in tropical semiarid regions.

funding_text 1={The TP loads per unit area were also presented in Fig. 3 to support a comparison among catchments. Despite the high TP loads estimated for Orós and Castanhão catchments, their values per unit area were relatively low: 4.4 and 7.2 kg km−2 yr−1, respectively. On the other hand, the catchment of Acarape do Meio presented the highest value, 39.3 kg km−2 yr−1, possibly as consequence of its relatively small area and potentially high river connectivity. This catchment presents the highest precipitation index, which also favors higher TP runoff. Contrastingly, Lun et al. (2018) found a net soil P budget for Brazilian croplands of about 500 kg km−2.yr−1. Although the loads in the studied catchments come from more uses than croplands, the values are very low compared to this national average. Lower precipitation indexes and the intermittent regime of the rivers, potentially reducing TP runoff, contribute to these low estimates. Additionally, the TP retention in the numerous small upstream reservoirs within the catchment impacts this result (Lima Neto et al., 2011; Mamede et al., 2012, 2018). Contrastingly, the Santo Anastácio reservoir presented a TP load per unit area of 2626 kg km−2 yr−1 (Araújo et al., 2019), significantly higher than the above-mentioned national average. This is a combined result of the high precipitation indexes in a small urban catchment that additionally disposes untreated sewage into the reservoir.The highest A coefficient shown in Table 3 was 11,776, about six times higher than the value of 1858 obtained in this study, suggesting a stronger influence of PS pollution. With regards to the A coefficient, the values reported by Bowes et al. (2014) were similar to those obtained in the presented study. As aforementioned, the similarities rely mainly in the NPS contribution to the catchments. The C coefficient, which mostly characterizes NPS contribution, reached the minimum values in this study in comparison with the others. In median terms, it was closer to the results obtained by Bowes et al. (2014). The minimum C value was fitted for the catchment of the Santo Anastácio reservoir. Accordingly, high C coefficients are not expected in urban catchments. Some particularities, such as B ≥ 1 and D ≤ 1 observed by Bowes et al. (2008), were not observed in the present study. The D and B coefficients were those more similar in all the studies. Particularly for the Santo Anastácio, the parameters related with the NPS pollution were nill. The model stated this way, accounting mainly PS contributions, reached the best performance. Additionally, this behavior is widely supported by the studies that highlighted sewer as the main TP input source for this water body (Pacheco and Lima Neto, 2017).The authors appreciate the financial support from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and the Ceará State Research Foundation – FUNCAP (Research Grant PNE-0112-00042.01.00/16), as well as the Water Resources Management Company of the State of Ceará (COGERH) for providing the data necessary for the analyses.},

abstract={Rangeland degradation is a global concern that is exacerbated by soil loss through water erosion. A deeper understanding of rainfall and runoff dynamics can assist in the development of sustainable management strategies. Current methods to measure surface runoff (e.g., natural runoff plots, rainfall simulation and overland flow experiments, modeling approaches) have many advantages but can be prohibitively expensive, may require considerable maintenance, and/or result in significant disturbance during installation. To address these limitations, we assessed a relatively new and underused method for monitoring runoff, the Upwelling Bernoulli Tube (UBeTube). The UBeTube is a low-cost, passive runoff monitoring method that estimates runoff from the height of water flowing out of a slot machined in the side of a vertical tube. In this study, we evaluated the UBeTube across a range of flow rates with three specific objectives: 1) calibrate the UBeTube measurements using clean water, 2) assess the impacts from varying sediment loads on UBeTube measurement accuracy, and 3) evaluate accuracy under conditions similar to those on undisturbed and disturbed rangelands. We found that properly calibrated UBeTubes could be a relatively accurate runoff monitoring method on rangelands (mean percent error = 7.7% clean water calibration, 34.1% sediment loading, 35.2% undisturbed overland flow, 17.7% disturbed overland flow). UBeTubes provide an alternative method to monitor runoff on rangelands that can augment current methods by providing near real-time measurements of runoff generated during natural precipitation events. Easily and rapidly deployed across the landscape, UBeTubes could allow for the relative measurement of spatially variable hydrologic dynamics and serve as another source of information for management decision-making processes and the creation of sustainable strategies for rangeland development. © 2021 The Society for Range Management},

abstract={Drip irrigation using fertilizers is one of the commonly used methods to save fertilizer and minimize the impacts of fertilizer on the soil and the environment. However, the clogging issue of drip fertigation systems has been the major limitation and may lead to system damage if fertilizer solution concentrations are not appropriately selected. Therefore, the head loss, flow rates, and clogging substances of screen and disc filters were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging under different injection rates (2%, 3%, and 4%) and fertilizer-water ratios (1:4, 1:5, and 1:6) in drip fertigation systems. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the clogging substances were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The results showed that the large injection rate caused uneven fertilization, and the recommend injection rates of the proportional fertilizer pump were 2% and 3%. In the same fertilizer solution concentration range, the difference in head loss of the screen filter (0.09–7.75 m) was larger than that of the disc filter (0.32–3.88 m), indicating that the anti-clogging performance of the disc filter was better. Meanwhile, the application scope of the fertilizer solution concentration of the screen filter was less than 0.117% and that of the disc filter was between 0.117% and 0.296%. There was a significant effect of the fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging (P < 0.05). The interaction between the fertilizer solution concentrations and filter types had a more significant effect on filter clogging (P < 0.01). The clogging substances consisted of undissolved phosphate fertilizers and silicates as well as carbonate and phosphate precipitations generated by chemical reactions. The clogging mechanism was a physical and chemical coupling process when using phosphate fertilizers. Therefore, the use of fertilizers, especially phosphate fertilizers, contributed to the generation of clogging substances. Fertilizer solution concentrations and type of fertilizers should therefore be considered in the anti-clogging performance of filters in drip fertigation systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Elemental sulfur (S0) reduction process has been demonstrated as an attractive and cost-efficient approach for metal-laden wastewater treatment in lab-scale studies. However, the system performance and stability have not been evaluated in pilot- or large-scale wastewater treatment. Especially, the sulfide production rate and microbial community structure may significantly vary from lab-scale system to pilot- or large-scale systems using real domestic sewage as carbon source, which brings questions to this novel technology. In this study, therefore, a pilot-scale sulfur-based sulfidogenic treatment system was newly developed and applied for the treatment of Cu-laden electroplating wastewaters using domestic sewage as carbon source. During the 175-d operation, &gt;99.9% of Cu2+ (i.e., 5580 and 1187 mg Cu/L for two types of electroplating wastewaters) was efficiently removed by the biogenic hydrogen sulfide that produced through S0 reduction. Relatively high level of sulfide production (200 mg S/L) can be achieved by utilizing organics in raw domestic sewage, which was easily affected by the organic content and pH value of the domestic sewage. The long-term feeding of domestic sewage significantly re-shaped the microbial community in sulfur-reducing bioreactors. Compared to the reported lab-scale bioreactors, higher microbial community diversity was found in our pilot-scale bioreactors. The presence of hydrolytic, fermentative and sulfur-reducing bacteria was the critical factor for system stability. Accordingly, a two-step ecological interaction among fermentative and sulfur-reducing bacteria was newly proposed for sulfide production: biodegradable particulate organic carbon (BPOC) was firstly degraded to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria. Then, sulfur-reducing bacteria utilized the total DOC (both DOC degraded from BPOC and the original DOC present in domestic sewage) as electron donor and reduced the S0 to sulfide. Afterwards, the sulfide precipitated Cu2+ in the post sedimentation tank. Compared with other reported technologies, the sulfur-based treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87.5‒99.6% for the same level of Cu2+ removal. Therefore, this pilot-scale study demonstrated that S0 reduction process can be a sustainable technology to generate sulfide for the co-treatment of Cu-laden electroplating wastewater and domestic sewage, achieving higher Cu2+removal and higher cost-effectiveness than the conventional technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The mechanisms of plastic transport in rivers remain an important knowledge gap in global plastic pollution research and management. We investigated how river flows and plastics' properties affect transport with a five-point cross-sectional field study in the Hillsborough River in Tampa (Florida, USA) using a 500-µm Neuston net and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. We conducted in-depth analysis of water velocity profiles as well as plastics' concentrations and properties, determining advective, vertical, and lateral transport fluxes. Under calm flow conditions, advective fluxes were two orders of magnitude higher than lateral and vertical fluxes. Under turbulent conditions, enhanced particle exchange in the cross-section resulted in a three to tenfold increase in lateral and vertical plastic fluxes. The impact of turbulence on plastic particles depended on properties such as size, shape, and composition. This study presents a unique assessment of flow conditions driving plastic pollution in an urban coastal river setting. Practitioners points: Multipoint, cross-sectional sampling and onsite flow profile collection should be adopted as a common practice for plastic field data collection to reduce uncertainty. Varying flow conditions affect the drivers of plastic transport in rivers. Advective surface fluxes govern plastic transport under calm flow conditions, while turbulent flow conditions enhance cross-sectional mixing and particle exchange. Larger and more irregular-shaped plastics are more affected by turbulence. © 2020 Water Environment Federation},

abstract={Assessing of the dynamics regularity of the ice regime main characteristics on the Debed River basin rivers is an important scientific and practical issue for water management planning and implementation, water resources rational use and protection, and climate change. The article highlighted several questions for the whole observation period, the duration of the ice phenomena period and the dates when ice phenomena onset explored. The ice phenomena observations data for the Debed River basin provided by the «Hydrometeorology and Monitoring Center» SNCO of the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Armenia. The study carried out for 15 locations at the Debed River basin based on a long-term time series (from 1939 up to 2018). Most of the Debed River basin rivers have unstable ice formation or do not freeze at all. Ice phenomena on the studied rivers have diverse features due to different climatic, morphometric and hydraulic conditions. Due to the high flow rates, ice is observed only in cold winters on the deep areas for a short period. Most rivers have various ice phenomena with different scales and duration. Also, there are almost no springs and autumn ice run and ice jams, but shore ice distributed wildly. Ice phenomena on rivers largely depend on the catchments altitude. On average for the river basin, ice phenomena usually begin from the second decade of November up to the third decade of December and end from the third decade of February up to the third decade of March. The changes dynamics in the beginning and end of ice events, the duration of ice events and ice cover at the Debed River basin assessed. Trends for two periods represented: 1966–1995 and 1996–2018. The changes in the dynamics of air and water temperatures, as well as of precipitation studied. The trend of air temperature is only positive, a more intensive increase of air temperature is observed in the period 1996–2018. The trend of water temperature and precipitation for the period 1966-1995 is negative, and for the period 1996– 2018 – positive. It was found that the current changes of the ice regime at the Debed River basin occur mainly under the influence of climate change conditions. In the context of climate change, there are shifts at the beginning of ice events to a later date, and at the end of ice events to an earlier date, which causes an ice phenomena duration reduction (especially since 1994 to 1995). © 2021, Faculty of Geology and Geography, Tomsk State University.

abstract={Flooding due to intensive precipitation poses a major threat to lives and property. Information about flood-prone areas is needed in order to reduce potential risks via mitigation and adaptation measures. The flood probability of a certain point in the landscape depends, firstly, on the projected frequency and characteristics of heavy rainfall events that generate surface runoff and, secondly, on the specific properties of the terrain that determine flow and runoff, e.g. the surface morphology and the hydraulic roughness of diverse surfaces or land uses. Simulation models of surface water flow are standard tools for the assessment of flood dynamics caused by extreme precipitation events. In order to make informed decisions that take modelling uncertainties into account as well as to get an idea of the probability space, it is necessary to quantify the effects of alternative sets of model parameters by drawing on different data sources as well as spatial and temporal resolutions of the input data. For the current study, we evaluated the impact of different parameter sets on the flow rate and velocity as determined for a study area in south-eastern Germany using the hydronumeric computational fluid dynamics model HiPIMS. The considered parameters were rainfall input (time and space invariant, spatially invariant and time varying, space and time varying), hydraulic roughness and spatial resolution of the digital elevation model. We present point-based time series of flow rates and velocities to indicate the bandwidths of probable flooding dynamics. Results show that the modelled flow rates and velocities are strongly dependent on the particular form of rainfall data as well as the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model. The effects of variations in hydraulic roughness are also found to be significant while in all cases the location of data capture points in the catchment area has a strong influence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Soil aeration is increasingly being used on haylands in the northeastern United States as a water quality best management practice to decrease runoff volumes and flow rates, and the associated export of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, there is a lack of data on the effects of soil aeration on field-scale hydrologic and nutrient fluxes in cold-climate regions.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil aeration prior to dairy manure application on edge-of-field hydrology, water quality, and P fluxes in haylands in Vermont, United States, during both precipitation and snowmelt-induced runoff events. Edge-of-field water quality monitoring techniques were used to continuously measure the losses of surface runoff and the associated export of sediment and nutrients year-round from 2012 to 2018. Additionally, passive-capillary lysimeter systems were used to measure the subsurface losses of P. Aeration reduced total suspended solids, total P, total N, and total dissolved N mean runoff-event concentrations by 22%, 32%, 25%, and 34%, respectively. Event mean surface runoff volume increased by 16% due to aeration, resulting in no significant reductions in nutrient load exports during nonwinter runoff events. However, total P and total dissolved P loads were significantly reduced during large winter thaw events, often occurring months after aeration took place. Potential increases in surface and subsurface hydrologic flows that accompany nutrient export reductions should be considered before implementation of soil aeration on haylands with high runoff producing soils in cold climate regions. © 2021 Soil Conservation Society of America.

abstract={The importance of water resources forecasting is growing due to changes in precipitation caused by climate change and with hydrologic models are being used mainly for water resource management. Calibration and validation through adjustment of parameters are important processes for increasing the reliability of the application of hydrologic models. This is different from flow rates that can be estimated in real time through level-flow rating curve. The reliability of data depends on observation; therefore, using data with a short can increase the reliability of the results. In this study, daily loads of suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) were generated using three statistical methods: general method, perfect prognosis method, and model output statistics (MOS). Fitness of calibration and validation of hydrologic models were then evaluated using correlation, R2, and anomaly analysis. When these three methods were applied to the Geumho and Hwang rivers, perfect prognosis method and the MOS method showed better results than the general method. For the Geumho River, correlation and R2 improved by up to 0.08% for SS, 0.04% for TN, and 0.12% for TP. For Hwang River, results improved by up to 27% for SS, 12% for TN, and 15% for TP. When the anomaly analysis results were represented by correlation and R2, they showed significant improvements of up to 0.86 in SS, 0.62 in TN, and 0.57 in TP for the Geumho River and up to 0.58 in SS, 0.49 in TN, and 0.49 in TP for the Hwang River. The statistical method suggested in this study can be applied when observation for the water quality data is long or data are insufficient. © 2020},

abstract={China implemented the National Wetland Conservation Program (NWCP) from 2002 to protect and rehabilitate wetlands. Under the background of sustainable development, assessment on the effectiveness of the NWCP is important to ecosystem management, especially in the Sanjiang Plain, the largest marsh distribution area and hotspot area with wetland loss. To achieve this aim, this study examined the changes in land cover and ecosystem services (ESs) from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2015 in the Sanjiang Plain as well as the nine national nature reserves for wetlands (NNRWs) by means of Landsat series images and the InVEST model. Results reveal that the NWCP played critical roles in reducing wetland loss and improving regional ESs. The shrinkage rate of wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain has been decreased remarkably, with a declined rate of wetland loss from 750 km2 yr−1 to 189 km2 yr−1. The reduction rate of habitat area in good suitable grade and ecosystem carbon stock declined notably during the period 2000–2015 compared to the period 1990–2000. The amount of water retention increased by 5.4%, while the grain production capacity was enhanced by nine times from 1990 to 2015. Specifically, since 2000, the reduction rate of wetland area in NNRWs (33 km2 yr−1) was obviously lower than that in the entire Sanjiang Plain, whilst various ESs in NNRWs were better than that in the whole Sanjiang Plain. This study is expected to provide an example for evaluating the effectiveness of the NWCP at other regions and support regional wetland conservation management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are a major source of surface water pollution and degradation. This is particularly visible where sewage collection with combined sewer and centralized treatment are well established, such as in Europe and North America: an overwhelming number of surface water bodies are in insufficient status of ecology, hydrology and physico-chemical parameters. Therefore, several countries have started implementing constructed wetlands (CWs) as mainstream on-spot treatment. This paper summarizes the main design approaches that can be adopted. We identified eight different schemes for the implementation of CSO-CWs, based on our international experience and documented by a literature analysis. The performance review includes conventional water quality parameters, as well as pathogen and emergent contaminant removal. Furthermore, modelling tools for advanced design and for understanding a wide applicability of these green infrastructures are presented. This paper also provides a review on other side benefits offered by the adoption of Nature-Based Solutions for CSO treatment, such as ecosystem services, and the most common issues related to their operation and maintenance. Our analysis has produced a list of key factors for design and operation, all derived from full-scale installations in operation up to more than ten years. © 2020},

abstract={The lack and inefficiency of urban drainage systems, as well as extreme precipitation, can lead to system overloading and, therefore, an urban pluvial flood. The study brings insights into this phenomenon from the perspective of the statistical relationship between precipitation and flooding parameters. The paper investigates the possibility of predicting sewer overloading based on the characteristics of the upcoming rain event using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and statistical methods. Additionally, it examines the influence of precipitation resolution on the model sensitivity regarding floods. The study is set in a small urban catchment in Dresden (Germany) with a separated stormwater sewer system (SWSS). The flood-event-based calibrated model runs with observed and designed heavy rain events of various sums, durations, and intensities. Afterward, the analysis focuses on precipitation and model overloading parameters (total flood volume, maximum flooding time and flow rate, and maximum nodal water depth) with pairwise correlation and multi-linear regression (MLR). The results indicate that it is possible to define a certain threshold (or range) for a few precipitation characteristics, which could lead to an urban flood, and fitting MLR can noticeably improve the predictability of the SWSS overloading parameters. The study concludes that design and observed rain events should be considered separately and that the resolution of the precipitation data (1/5/10 min) does not play a significant role in SWSS overloading. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Surface run-off (SR) produced on the territory of cities and other settlement as a result of atmospheric precipitation is an intensive source of the technogenic pollution of environment, including the waterbodies. In accordance with the existing legislation of the Russian Federation, SR requires organized disposal and treatment according to the standards of regulatory documents. In this article we analyze the European document BS EN 752:2017 with regard to determining the flow-rates of surface (storm-water) run-off, and the calculations are made by the authors, which demonstrate that the application of foreign software products is impossible in Russia, due to the differences between the existing Russian regulatory and methodological documents and the European standards. Nevertheless, for the development of electronic models of hydraulic calculations for a storm-water drainage network, the mathematical relationship, which most adequately characterizes the type of surface run-off hydrograph most frequent for the territory of the Russian Federation as a result of atmospheric precipitation, was found. The relevant algorithm of the hydraulic calculation of storm-water drainage networks was also developed. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Although numerous studies have acknowledged that vegetation can reduce erosion, few process-based studies have examined how vegetation cover affect runoff hydraulics and erosion processes. We present field observations of overland flow hydraulics using rainfall simulations in a typical semiarid area in China. Field plots (5 × 2 m2) were constructed on a loess hillslope (25°), including bare soil plot as control and three plots with planted forage species as treatments—Astragalus adsurgens, Medicago sativa and Cosmos bipinnatus. Both simulated rainfall and simulated rainfall + inflow were applied. Forages reduced soil loss by 55–85% and decreased overland flow rate by 12–37%. Forages significantly increased flow hydraulic resistance expressed by Darcy–Weisbach friction factor by 188–202% and expressed by Manning's friction factor by 66–75%; and decreased overland flow velocity by 28–30%. The upslope inflow significantly increased overland flow velocity by 67% and stream power by 449%, resulting in increased sediment yield rate by 108%. Erosion rate exhibited a significant linear relationship with stream power. M. sativa exhibited the best in reducing soil loss which probably resulted from its role in reducing stream power. Forages on the downslope performed better at reducing sediment yield than upslope due to decreased rill formation and stream power. The findings contribute to an improved understanding of using vegetation to control water and soil loss and land degradation in semiarid environments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The flash flood occurring on May 25, 1872 ranks among the most extreme events recorded within the Czech Republic. The causative torrential rain affected mostly the area between Karlovy Vary, Plzeň and Prague of approximately 2000 km2. A corresponding intensity of precipitation observed incidentally at two sites exceeded 200 mm in 3–8 h. The consequent flood caused tremendous damages to ponds, houses, and infrastructure and resulted in a temporary collapse of transport especially due to a total break of trains operation. The flood led to approximately 240–300 fatalities according to various sources. An extent of the total area affected reached approximately 2000–3000 km2 representing an unusually large scale for such a type of flood. The intensive rain and inflow caused the biggest rupture of a water reservoir in Mladotice so far. The respective Mladotický pond held very likely 3–4 million cubic meters of water before its rupture. With a delay of 2 to 3 days, a substantial saturation triggered a massive landslide blocking the Mladotický water stream and creating a new water body named the Odlezelské Lake. The flood event motivated elaboration of at least 3 scholarly papers already between 1872 and 1875. Accordingly, this flood presents for Czech hydrologists an outstanding example of such an extreme magnitude until now. The flood in 1872 and drought in 1874 led directly to establishing the Hydrological service of the Czech Kingdoms in 1875. Hitherto, we have no comparison for such extreme flood including recent floods occurring in 2002, 2010 and 2013. The flood peaks exceeded other historical or recent floods by at least 1–2 m. There is only one similar flood event, the flood of July 31, 1714 at the Sázava River catchment. As there were no regular hydrological observations including precipitation measurements available for the affected areas before 1883, the prevailing data source comprise documentary sources and their relevant interpretations. The aim of our study is to explain in a more detail the course of this flood and a number of indeterminate circumstances during the flood. An important question was an effect of the collapse of approximately 100 ponds and a role of the collapsed sizeable Mladotický pond. These phenomena were partly explained by newspapers and chronicles describing an incredibly rapid increase of water level (2–3 m in a few minutes) at a relatively large number of sites. We have completed a hydraulic estimation of peak discharges at major profiles. In our research we used the Aqualog hydrological modelling system. The hydrological modelling enabled us to complete and check the reliability of observed causative precipitation for the affected area and peak flow rates at the Beroun and Prague municipalities. An important point was the reconstruction of a flow hydrograph at Prague with very intricate shape and two likely local peaks. Second local maximum could be attributed to the collapse of the Mladotický pond. This flood is of crucial importance for the Prague flood protection system. The main reason being a short time span of 22 h between the beginning of causative rainfall and occurrence of maximum flood flow rate at Prague. © 2019},

abstract={Pesticides are important for agriculture in the United States, and atrazine is one of the most widely used and widely detected pesticides in surface water. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which atrazine and its degradation product, deethylatrazine, increase and decrease in surface waters can help inform future decisions for water quality improvement. This study considers causal factors for trends in pesticide concentration in U.S. streams and models the causal factors, other than use, in structural equation models. The structural equation models use a concomitant trend in corn (Zea mays L.) and a latent variable model, indicating moisture supply and management. The moisture supply and management latent variable model incorporates long-term moisture conditions in the individual watersheds by using the Palmer hydrologic drought index, human influence on the hydrologic cycle through the percentage of the watershed drained by tile drains in 2012, and the base-flow contribution to streamflow, using the base-flow index. The structural equation models explain 77 and 38% of the variability in atrazine and deethylatrazine trends, respectively, across the conterminous United States. The models highlight future water quality challenges, particularly in tile-drained settings where fall precipitation and heavy precipitation are increasing. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={This study sought to evaluate the cumulative effect of the implementation of green space depressions to promote disconnection of impervious areas within residential lots on runoff generation and temporal patterns in a small urban area characterized by high imperviousness. Three hypothetical scenarios were proposed with variations in the disconnection rate (α) within the lot, the soil infiltration conditions, and the rainfall patterns. Simulations were performed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) with the implementation of a high spatial resolution model which allowed the explicit representation of the routing runoff between distinct surfaces. The results revealed a linear relationship trend between the total amount of rainfall (P) and total runoff (q), with identification of a possible precipitation threshold above the point at which a more critical condition of runoff generation is established. The value of this threshold was shown to be dependent on the degree of efficiency of the receptor permeable areas, which is associated with the disconnection rate and infiltrability of the soil. The results also showed that for a very high disconnection rate and lower infiltrability, runoff can increase substantially, with significant changes in the hydrographs simulated for longer storm events. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent decades, Malaysia has become one of the world's most urbanized nations, causing severe flash flooding. Urbanization should meet the population's needs by increasing the development of paved areas, which has significantly changed the catchment's hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. Therefore, the frequency of flash flooding in Malaysia's urban areas has grown year after year. Numerous techniques have been used, including the statistical approach, modeling, and storm design methods, in flood simulation. This research integrated hydrology and hydraulic models to simulate the urban flood events in the Aur River catchment. The primary objective is to determine water level and forecast peak flow based on hydrological assessment in the drainage system using XPSWMM software. The rainfall data for 60 min was used for this study in the hydrological analysis by obtaining an intensity-duration-frequency curve and peak flow value (Q peak). XPSWMM is used to simulate the response of a catchment to rainfall events in which runoff, water depth profile, and outflow hydrograph are obtained. Peak runoff is also obtained from the modified rational method for validation purposes. The proposed method was verified by comparing the result with the standard method. This is essential to identify flash flooding, which can lead to efficient flood mitigation planning and management in the urban catchment. The increase in residential areas results in the alteration of time of concentration, water quantity, and flow rate. Thus, to mitigate present and future problems, the effects of urbanization on water resources and flood should be analyzed. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The simulation of snowmelt runoff in alpine mountainous areas is of great significance not only for the risk assessment of snowmelt flood in spring and summer, but also for the development and management of water resources in the basin. An improved snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is constructed based on the analysis of change characteristics of climate, runoff, and snow and ice cover in the middle and upper reaches of the Taxkorgan River in Xinjiang Province, China. Because of the large evaporation in the study basin, the evaporation loss is added to the model. The SRM and the improved SRM are calibrated and verified by using data such as temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, and snow-covered area (SCA) ratio in the study basin from 2002 to 2012. The results show that, compared with the SRM, the average Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) of annual runoff simulation increases from 0.80 to 0.86 in the calibration and increases from 0.74 to 0.83 in the validation through the improved model, and the average runoff error reduces from − 12.8 to 1.32% in the calibration and reduces from − 20.0 to − 11.51% in the validation. After adding the measured flow rate for real-time correction, the average NSE of annual runoff simulation increases from 0.91 to 0.93 and the average annual runoff error reduces from − 7.76 to − 3.91% in the calibration. The average NSE increases from 0.85 to 0.89 and the average runoff error reduces from − 12.35 to − 2.76% in the validation. It indicates that the SRM structure with increased evaporation loss is more in line with the actual situation. The short-term simulation effect of the model is greatly improved by adding the measured flow rate for real-time correction. At the same time, the improved SRM and the hypothetical climate change scenario are used to analyze the impact analysis of the snowmelt runoff simulation in the partial wet year. The results show that in the case of rising temperature, the ice and snow ablation period is prolonged, and the annual runoff also changes significantly in time distribution. It is of guiding significance for the influence of climate change on the runoff of recharged rivers with ice–snow meltwater in the other alpine regions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Investigation of precipitation characteristics on daily, monthly, and annual time scales can contribute to gaining important information related to temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation or even flow rate challenges (e.g., hydrological droughts). The low levels of long-term precipitation and high variability in different time scales are considered the main inherent characteristics of climate in Iran. Due to the direct effects of precipitation on water resources, especially on the river flow rate, it is necessary to assess the efficient indices to visualize the variations in the components of water resources. One of the main indices is the precipitation concentration index (PCI) which is known as a strong indicator of the precipitation distribution generally used on annual and seasonal scales. In this study, drought analysis in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) located in northwest of Iran was performed with the daily river flow rate and monthly precipitation values within the period of 1984–2013. The results of changes in precipitation indicated that the irregularity of precipitation distribution had grown in spring months. Also, due to the diminishing precipitation trend on the annual time scale, PCI index also increased. It is concluded that LUB detected a significant descending trend on the annual, spring, and winter time scales in the last 30 years. The PCI values were proved high irregularity in summer with PCI amount of 20.1 and most regularity in winter with PCI amount of 10.4. This paper also aims to assess the effects of PCI on the river flow rate along with the flow shortness volume values using hydrometric and rain gauge stations within LUB. The results obtained from the changes in river flow rate and flow shortness volume revealed that the river flow rate has mostly a falling trend. Finally, it was observed that the time when the river flow rate data changed happened after beginning of changes in the precipitation data. A decrease in inflow from 900 million cubic meters up to 14 billion cubic meters with high flow shortness volume may happen in worst conditions. These results highlighted the importance of applying water resources management in LUB. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The city of Nîmes is exposed to flood risks (especially to flash floods). No major river flows in the dense urban area of the city. Instead, dry canals called "cadereaux"cross the city and are used to collect water runoff. The Mediterranean rains, the small catchment basins (size under 30 km2) and the karstic type as well as the piedmont situation are factors bringing about significant runoff with major overflow and flash floods. After the floods that took place on the 3rd of October 1988, the city of Nîmes launched a new ambitious policy aiming at preventing flooding risks, including important works on the "cadereaux". In 2004, as part of this process, the city implemented an alert system ESPADA (Evaluation et suivi des précipitations en agglomération pour devancer l'alerte). The goal of this system is to forecast the "cadereaux"flow rates up to 1 h 30 ahead, by using a hydrological model with sharp representation of the karstic ecosystem. In 2014, within the framework of the Programs of Actions for Inundations Prevention, the city of Nîmes initiated the modernization of the ESPADA system to improve the quality of the input data in real time (5-min time step). A radio network dedicated to the collection of the data (through the city's hydrometeorological sensors) was put in place, thus offering a secure and efficient data collection. The radio network also enables real-time data collection from the SPC-GD (Service de prévision des crues du Grand Delta, regional office in charge of flood prevention) stations. Furthermore, the city developed a high resolution spatial radar which enables rain measurement and forecasting. By using 500 m pixels waves, this tool can identify local intensities on the small drainage basins. Data calibration is made with rain gauges which are available. As part of the second step of modernization, the forecasting model is now being improved in order to work continuously with 5-min time step. The propagation is managed by 1D hydraulic model. In addition, the linmnigraphic data are used in real time to update the flow rates values and the storage levels of the basins. Similarly, a web interface is currently under development, allowing crisis-management key-players to efficiently use the risk mitigation tools. Over time, the general public will have access to some of the ESPADA system, using an interface similar to the Vigicrues portal. © SHF, Published by EDP Sciences, 2019.},

abstract={Research Highlights: Investigations of evapotranspiration in a mature mixed beech-fir forest stand do not indicate higher resilience towards intensified drying-wetting cycles as compared with pure beech stands. Background and Objectives: Forest management seeks to implement adaptive measures, for example, the introduction of more drought resistant species into prevailing monospecific stands to minimize forest mortality and monetary losses. In Central Europe this includes the introduction of native silver fir (Abies alba) into monospecific beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands. In order to determine, if the introduction of fir would improve the resilience against drier conditions, this study investigates water relations of a mature pure beech and a mature mixed beech-fir stand under natural as well as reduced water availability. Materials and Methods: Sap flow rates and densities were measured in two consecutive years using the heat ratio method and scaled using stand inventory data and modeling. Results: Transpiration rates estimated from sap flow were significantly higher for beech trees as compared with silver fir which was attributed to the more anisohydric water-use strategy of the beech trees. We estimate that stand evapotranspiration was slightly higher for mixed stands due to higher interception losses from the mixed stand during times of above average water supply. When precipitation was restricted, beech was not able to support its transpiration demands, and therefore there was reduced sap flow rates in the mixed, as well as in the pure stand, whereas transpiration of fir was largely unaffected, likely due to its more isohydric behavior toward water use and access to moister soil layers. Thus, we found the rates of evapotranspiration in the mixed beech-fir stand to be smaller during times with no precipitation as compared with the pure beech stand, which was accountable to the severely reduced transpiration of beech in the mixed stand. Conclusions: We conclude that smaller evapotranspiration rates in the mixed beech-fir stand might not be the result of increased water use efficiency but rather caused by restricted hydraulic conductivity of the root system of beech, making mixed beech-fir stands at this site less resilient towards drought. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={One of the aims of this paper was to study catchment and watercourse response to extreme events. The study area consisted of Orunski Stream in the northern Polish city of Gdansk. The study period (review of cartographic materials) covered the years 1908 to 2000, while field research covered the period from May 2009 to April 2010. In addition, measurements were performed to study the dynamics of changes occurring in the creek during rainfall events. Examination of the water chemistry changes made two days before heavy rainfall showed a significant increase in sulphates and nitrogen compounds. Additionally, pollutants washed from the basin contributed to a significant deterioration in the water colour. A rainfall of 1.3 mm caused an eleven-fold increase in stream flow, a twofold increase in the water level, and a fourfold increase in the velocity of water molecules. It might appear seem that such a small amount of rainfall would have no major effect on the hydrologic and hydrochemical parameters of a small creek. However, it is the maximum flow rate that is an important variable when assessing potential flood risk levels. © 2019 Łukasz Pietruszyński et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

abstract={Nitrate (NO 3 − N) export from row crop agricultural systems with subsurface tile drainage continues to be a major water quality concern. Woodchip bioreactors are an effective edge-of-field practice designed to remove NO 3 − N from tile drainage. The NO 3 − N removal rate of woodchip bioreactors can be impacted by several factors, including hydraulic residence time (HRT). This study examined the impact of three HRTs, 2 h, 8 h, and 16 h, on NO 3 − N removal in a set of nine pilot-scale woodchip bioreactors in Central Iowa. NO 3 − N concentration reduction from the inlet to the outlet was significantly different for all HRTs (p &lt; 0.05). The 16 h HRT removed the most NO 3 − N by concentration (7.5 mg L −1 ) and had the highest removal efficiency at 53.8%. The 8 h HRT removed an average of 5.5 mg L −1 NO 3 − N with a removal efficiency of 32.1%. The 2 h HRT removed an average of 1.3 mg L −1 NO 3 − N with a removal efficiency of 9.0%. The 2 h HRT had the highest NO 3 − N mass removal rate (MRR) at 9.0 g m −3 day −1 , followed by the 8 h HRT at 8.5 g m −3 day −1 , and the 16 h HRT at 7.4 g m −3 day −1 , all of which were statistically different (p &lt; 0.05). Significant explanatory variables for removal efficiency were HRT (p &lt; 0.001) and influent NO 3 − N concentration (p &lt; 0.001), (R 2 = 0.80), with HRT accounting for 93% contribution. When paired with results from a companion study, the ideal HRT for the bioreactors was 8 h to achieve maximum NO 3 − N removal while reducing the impact from greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019},

abstract={Using combined sewer systems to handle excess stormwater runoff is common in older urban areas. Combined sewer overflow (CSO) events occur when hydraulic capacity is exceeded, and untreated wastewater discharges to surface waters. As urban population density increases, and more demand is placed on infrastructure, CSO events happen more often and cause serious environmental problems and public-health risks. Recently, green infrastructure (GI) has been integrated with existing gray infrastructure (GrayI) to reduce CSO events. However, there lacks a goal-oriented planning framework for eliminating CSOs at a watershed/sewershed scale. Moreover, existing stormwater simulations based on catchments or other geographic units, do not consider spatial variation within the unit, such as distribution, attribution, ownership, and management of GI. We propose a scenario-based Stormwater Management Planning Support System for CSOs (SMPSS-CSO) to provide a platform for reducing CSO events by coordinating parcel-based installations of GI. We applied the SMPSS-CSO to a sewershed with a single CSO location in Cincinnati, Ohio and developed four scenarios representing increased use of GI (rain barrels, green roofs, porous pavements, and detention basin) based on its cost, difficulty of installation, and property ownership. Runoff quantity, time of concentration, and peak flow rate were simulated using the curve number method. Our analysis shows a 41% reduction in stormwater runoff is necessary to eliminate CSO events for a two-year rainfall, required 97.25% of private and 27.59% of public parcels to install GI. GI alone cannot eliminate CSO events in this sewershed and must be incorporated with additional GrayI (e.g., storage tanks, pipes).

abstract={Changes in environmental flow regime due to hydraulic construction projects and variability in precipitation patterns due to climate change over the past several years have increased the stress on ecohydrology, and the indiscreet use of water has had a negative impact on the water environment in natural rivers and hydro structures. Previous studies on typhoon precipitation have simply estimated the intensity, duration, frequency, and magnitude of typhoon precipitations, but the study of the effects on water resource and ecosystem operations by separating typhoon precipitations from warm season precipitations was relatively inadequate. Therefore, this study investigated the characteristics of quantitative hydrological changes related to daily flow data of dam inflows considering the effects of the typhoon. According to the peak flow rate and frequency analysis, there is a distinct increase trend in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Also, during non-typhoon periods, low flow rates are frequent, but low-flow changes due to typhoons are not significant. The results of this study could be used as a useful resource for establishing scientific measures for the preparation and coordination of responses to the changes in water and ecological environment systems in a changing climate. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Water erosion on hillslopes is a worldwide environmental problem, which is a rainfall-induced process, especially extreme rainfall. The great intensity of extreme rainfall strongly enhances the power of overland flow to detach soil and transport sediment. Plant litter is one of the most important constituents of ecosystems that often covers the soil surface and can be incorporated into topsoil. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on flow hydraulics owing to the veiled nature. This study aimed to examine the effects of incorporated litter on the hydraulic properties under extreme rainfall condition. To reach this goal, six litter rates of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.35, and 0.50 kg m −2 and four litter types collected from deciduous trees, coniferous trees, shrubs, and herbs were incorporated into topsoil. Then, simulated rainfall experiments were performed on five slope gradients (5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, and 25°) with an extreme rainfall intensity of 80 mm h −1 . The results showed that Froude number and flow velocity of the overland flow decreased, whereas flow resistance increased exponentially with litter incorporation rate. Litter type had an influence on flow hydraulics, which can mainly be attributed to the variations in surface coverage of the exposed litter and the litter morphology. Flow velocity and Darcy–Weisbach coefficient increased markedly with slope gradient. However, the variation of slope gradient did not modify the relationships between flow hydraulics and incorporated litter rate. The random roughness, resulting from heterogeneous erosion due to the uneven protection of surface exposed litter, increased linearly with litter incorporated rate. As rainfall proceeded, flow hydraulics varied with incorporated litter rate and slope gradient complicatedly due to the increases in flow rate and coverage of the exposed litter and the modification of soil surface roughness. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In order to improve the efficiency of water-saving irrigation in agriculture, the round rotatory jet sprinkler was proposed. The CFD numerical simulation method of the sprinkler was determined. Depth-to-width ratio (k/w), potential difference ratio, split distance ratio and side wall angel were selected as the experimental factors, and frequency of wall-attached switching and flow amplitude were taken as the indexes. The optimum structure of internal channel of sprinkler was obtained by orthogonal test. By means of high-speed photography technology, the frequency of wall-attached switching of jet was measured, and the inlet flow rate of sprinkler was monitored. The results showed that the simulated flow-pressure relation was basically consistent with the experimental results. The relative error range was from 2.1% to 4.0%, and the variation trend of the frequency of wall-attached switching of jet with the inlet pressure was basically the same, and the relative error range was from 7.7% to 22.2%. When the inlet pressure was 0.15 MPa, 0.20 MPa and 0.25 MPa, the hydraulic properties of PY210A impact sprinkler and jet sprinkler were studied, respectively. The flow rate of jet sprinkler was small (1.19~1.53 m3/h), and the range was long (13.0~15.7 m), the sprinkler irrigation intensity was small (2.85~3.63 mm/h), and the rotation period was short (81~105 s). The precipitation of impact sprinkler was "saddle", the precipitation near and far away was relatively large, the precipitation of jet sprinkler was "triangle", and the precipitation was decreased with the increase of range. The research provided a reference for the structure design and hydraulic performance optimization of the round rotatory jet sprinkler. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

abstract={A field-pilot bioreactor exploiting microbial iron (Fe) oxidation and subsequent arsenic (As) and Fe co-precipitation was monitored during 6 months for the passive treatment of As-rich acid mine drainage (AMD). It was implemented at the Carnoulès mining site (southern France) where AMD contained 790–1315 mg L −1 Fe(II) and 84–152 mg L −1 As, mainly as As(III) (78–83%). The bioreactor consisted in five shallow trays of 1.5 m 2 in series, continuously fed with AMD by natural flow. We monitored the flow rate and the water physico-chemistry including redox Fe and As speciation. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was calculated and the precipitates formed inside the bioreactor were characterized (mineralogy, Fe and As content, As redox state). Since As(III) oxidation improves As retention onto Fe minerals, bacteria with the capacity to oxidize As(III) were quantified through their marker gene aioA. Arsenic removal yields in the pilot ranged between 3% and 97% (average rate (1.8 ± 0.8) ✕ 10 −8 mol L −1 s −1 ), and were positively correlated to HRT and inlet water dissolved oxygen concentration. Fe removal yields did not exceed 11% (average rate (7 ± 5) ✕ 10 −8 mol L −1 s −1 ). In the first 32 days the precipitate contained tooeleite, a rare arsenite ferric sulfate mineral. Then, it evolved toward an amorphous ferric arsenate phase. The As/Fe molar ratio and As(V) to total As proportion increased from 0.29 to 0.86 and from ∼20% to 99%, respectively. The number of bacterial aioA gene copies increased ten-fold during the first 48 days and stabilized thereafter. These results and the monitoring of arsenic speciation in the inlet and the outlet water, provide evidences that As(III) oxidized in the pilot. The biotreatment system we designed proved to be suitable for high As DMA. The formation of sludge highly enriched into As(V) rather than As(III) is advantageous in the perspective of long term storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In a joint research project of the Zittau/Goerlitz University of Applied Sciences, the Technische Universität Dresden, and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, the main emphasis is the time-related assignment of simultaneous and interacting mechanisms at zinc sources and zinc sinks at boundary conditions of a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) in German pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The required experiments are carried out at semitechnical and laboratory scales. Zinc is used as a protective coating, e.g., for gratings in the containment, showing high corrosion resistance due to a gradual formation of passivating layers. In contrast, its long-term behavior during LOCA changes significantly under the influence of the coolant chemistry of German PWRs. As a consequence, installations in the containment act as zinc sources. Released zinc ions change the chemical properties of the coolant and could, e.g., lead to layer-forming depositions of zinc borates in the core, which increases the possibility of a hindered heat dissipation. For experimental and methodical investigations of these phenomena, the test rig Zittau flow tray, a scaled sump model of a German PWR, was equipped with a full-length 3 × 3 fuel assembly dummy acting as core model, a preheater, and a cooler component. Nine 4.4-m-long fuel rod dummies simulate the decay heat by internal heating cartridges. This rig design enables experimental investigation of physicochemical mechanisms considering coolant containing boric acid and zinc and their influence on the thermohydraulic processes in the reactor core at post-LOCA boundary conditions. Additional zinc corrosion and zinc borate precipitation studies to elucidate chemical zinc corrosion mechanisms and dependencies of those processes on typical LOCA parameters were carried out using lab-scale corrosion/precipitation test facilities. The time-dependent zinc release at hot-dip galvanized gratings (HGGs) was investigated regarding their position (e.g., inside or near the leaking jet, freely suspended, or submerged in the coolant) and their surface area as well as the temperature and flow rate of the coolant. The experimental database allows the approximation of corrosion rates in dependence of HGG position and the accident-specific coolant leakage rate as well as first mathematical approaches for the modeling of zinc sources. © 2019, © 2019 American Nuclear Society.},

abstract={Migration of fine particles within internally unstable granular soils under water seepage flow (suffusion) is one of the most common causes of earth infrastructures’ failure. To assess the ability of Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) to prevent the segregation in an internally unstable soil, internal erosion tests were conducted upon soil samples treated by bacteria and cementation solutions. MICP experiments were carried out with concentrations of urea/CaCl2 equal to 1.4 M. Volumes of injected bacteria solutions were equal to the volumetric water content corresponding to different tested degrees of saturation (Sr): 30, 60 and 80%. Cementation solutions were injected three times for each sample. Biochemical properties of MICP were examined to predict bacterial movement through soil matrices as a function of Sr. The amount of the CaCO3 produced was examined depending on Sr. Following their treatment, samples were saturated and submitted to increment of hydraulic gradients varying from 0.1 to 10. Eroded fine particles masses, seepage flow rates and effective hydraulic gradients along samples were measured throughout the experiment. The results of our study pointed out that MICP stabilized internally unstable granular soils as the critical gradient went from 0.7 for untreated samples to 5 for biocemented samples. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The runoff from heavy rainfall reaches urban streams quickly, causing them to rise rapidly. It is therefore of great importance to provide sufficient lead time for evacuation planning and decision making. An efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence) water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection workers. The results are compared with real-time water level observations of the Dorim Stream. Finally, we verify the validity of the flash flood warning criteria by comparing the predicted values with the observed values and performing validity analysis. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This is the first study of the industrial scale application for phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite by the innovative ePhos technology. Phosphorus was recovered from centrate-water of a German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The ePhos technology: The patented ePhos technology is an electrochemical phosphorus-precipitation process. It takes place in an electrolytic cell consisting of an inert cathode and a sacrificial anode made of magnesium (Mg). By the cathodic reduction water splitting takes place: OH- ions are formed that raise the pH while hydrogen gas (H2) is evolved. At the anode, the oxidation of metallic Mg takes place: Magnesium ions dissolve and react with the phosphate and ammonium contained in the water to form struvite. The pilot-plant: The pilot plant consisted of two cells (Figure 1) with a total hydraulic capacity of 12 m 3 /h. For the separation of struvite sedimentation tank with a total surface of 20 m 2 was employed. The cell geometry was flat and each cell had a reaction surface of 0.3 m 2 . Magnesium sacrifice electrodes with a total mass of 210 kg were arranged as flat sheets parallel to each other. The pilot plants treated the phosphorus-rich centrate-water of the dewatered digested sludge. Different feed volume flow rates at a set current of 30 A between 0.4 m 3 /h and 1.5 m 3 /h per cell were tested for the derivation of the optimum conditions in terms of maximization of the phosphorus recovery and specific elimination kinetics, as well as minimization of the energy consumption and magnesium dosing. The influences of the frequency of polarity reversal and the galvanic operation with no current application were also investigated. Part of the effluent of the sedimentation tank was recirculated back to the cells at a rate of 4 m 3 /(h and cell). Copyright © 2018 Water Environment Federation},

abstract={Impact of drought stress on terrestrial plants is predicted to increase in future due to rapid increase in air temperature and changes in precipitation patterns. Mulberry (Morus spp.) is an economically important perennial crop in sericulture industry. The present study was aimed at using hydraulic dynamics and photosynthetic performance for screening drought tolerance among mulberry genotypes by using non-invasive, rapid and efficient methods. Plant hydraulic variables were measured with commercially available sap flow meter, stem and leaf psychrometers in one year old mulberry genotypes. Plant leaf gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured in control and stressed plants to assess their efficiency. Based on hydraulics and photosynthetic parameters, mulberry genotypes were characterized into 3 functional groups including high, average and poor performing groups (HPG, APG and LPG respectively). HPG genotypes maintained significantly better leaf water status (ψmd), stem hydraulic conductance (Ks) and sap flow rate (F) which resulted in enhanced photosynthetic efficiency compared to APG, LPG under prolonged drought regimes as well as after recovery. Hydraulic parameters were positively correlated with photosynthetic performance of each group under drought. Our data suggest that plant water transport efficiency plays a major role in regulating photosynthetic performance which in turn determines the biomass yields under drought. Hydraulic dynamics based screening will be highly useful for rapid selection of efficient mulberry genotypes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Land cover changes associated with urbanization have negative effects on downstream ecosystems. Contemporary urban development attempts to mitigate these effects by designing stormwater infrastructure to mimic predevelopment hydrology, but their performance is highly variable. This study used in situ monitoring of recently built neighbourhoods to evaluate the catchment-scale effectiveness of landscape decentralized stormwater control measures (SCMs) in the form of street connected vegetated swales for reducing runoff volumes and flow rates relative to curb-and-gutter infrastructure. Effectiveness of the SCMs was quantified by monitoring runoff for 8 months at the outlets of 4 suburban catchments (0.76–5.25 ha) in Maryland, USA. Three “grey” catchments installed curb-and-gutter stormwater conveyances, whereas the fourth “green” catchment built parcel-level vegetated swales. The catchment with decentralized SCMs reduced runoff, runoff ratio, and peak runoff compared with the grey infrastructure catchments. In addition, the green catchment delayed runoff, resulting in longer precipitation–runoff lag times. Runoff ratios across the monitoring period were 0.13 at the green catchment and 0.37, 0.35, and 0.18 at the 3 grey catchments. Runoff only commenced after 6 mm of precipitation at the decentralized SCM catchment, whereas runoff occurred even during the smallest events at the grey catchments. However, as precipitation magnitudes reached 20 mm, the green catchment runoff characteristics were similar to those at the grey catchments, which made up 37% of the total precipitation in only 10 of 72 events. Therefore, volume-based reduction goals for stormwater using decentralized SCMs such as vegetated swales require additional redundant SCMs in a treatment train as source control and/or end-of-pipe detention to capture a larger fraction of runoff and more effectively mimic predevelopment hydrology for the relatively rare but larger precipitation events.

abstract={The long-term dynamics of mercury in bottom sediments of Uglich Reservoir were examined. Samples of the 0–5-cm surface layer of bottom sediment collected during research expeditions in 1958, 1977, 1991, and 2012 were analyzed. An increase in the average mercury concentration from 1958 to 1977 (0.440 ± 0.039 and 0.668 ± 0.065 mg/kg d.w., respectively) was followed by a decrease in 2012 (0.260 ± 0.021 mg/kg d.w.). During all years except 1991, a significant correlation was found between mercury content and the amount of organic matter in the sediments (r = 0.54–0.87, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.01), flow velocity (r = 0.38–0.53, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.01), and the rate of sedimentation in the reservoir (r = − 0.51 to − 0.69, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.01). Calculations based on these results and previously published data from the study region on the density of atmospheric mercury precipitation showed that the watershed as a whole received 2.4–3.0 t on an annual basis, and in the same period, the water surface received 9.7–12.8 kg of mercury. The bottom sediment contained 4.31 (2012)–7.40 (1977) tons of mercury. Thus, most of the mercury in the Uglich Reservoir is assumed to originate from runoff and terrigenous sources within the watershed. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Hydrologic modeling plays an important role in hydrologic response prediction for water resources managements, flood control and soil and water conservation. Performance evaluation is necessary before using a hydrologic model in a watershed. Various traditional evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliff (E), correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and index of agreement (d) are commonly used for the performance evaluation of hydrologic models. All these criteria compare the model output with observed data, however they cannot capture all the features reproduced by the hydrologic models such as information content of data and stochastic relationship between rainfall and run-off. This is doubly important when carrying out frequency analysis on the model output. This study aims at introducing a new application of copulas for the performance evaluation of hydrologic models in accurate simulation of stochastic relationship between rainfall and runoff. To this end, IHACRES hydrologic model was selected for daily flow simulation in the Taleghan watershed. The selected model was calibrated for the 5-year period of 1995-2000 and evaluated for 5-year period of 2000-2005. The non-linear module calibration optimized the parameters C, τw and F as 0.002 mm, 22 days and 4 degree Celsius respectively. The linear module parameters was also optimized as τq = 0.02 days, τs = 41.25 days and vs = 1. Performance evaluation of the model via Nash-Sutcliff (E=0.75), Pearson correlation coefficient (R= 0.87), root mean square error (RMSE=7.2) and index of agreement (d=0.93) indicated a good performance of the model for the evaluation period. Although the numerical performance evaluation criteria show satisfying results, however visual inspection of the scatter plot of observed and simulated flow showed that the model significantly underestimated the peak flows in spring. In contrast, the winter flow rate is noticeably overestimated. Regarding the Mediterranean climate of the study area, the greater portion of the winter precipitation falls as snow which piles up in mountains without draining into the river network. With the onset of spring and warming weather, the snow pack melting accompanied with spring precipitations lead to the peak flow generation in spring. As the snowmelt simulation module is not included in the model, the model considered all precipitation as rain in January, February and March. This lead to the overestimation of winter flow rate. On the other hand, the spring peak flows is underestimated because of neglecting the snowmelt runoff. In the next step various copula functions with different tail dependence structure in the upper and lower tail including Archimedean copulas (Clayton, rotated Clayton, Gumbel, rotated Gumbel, Frank) and elliptical copulas (Gaussian, t-copulas) were fitted on observed and simulated rainfall-runoff time series. Various goodness-of-fit test criteria AIC, BIC and Log likelihood (LL) were employed to choose the best fit copula functions for the observed and modeled time series. Results showed that the Clayton copula with the lowest AIC, BIC and LL values (AIC = –236.28, BIC = –236.28 and LL = –118.13) best fitted observed rainfall-runoff time series. Gaussian copula with lowest AIC, BIC and LL values (AIC = –217.08 BIC = –217.08 and LL = –108.54) was also selected as the best fitted copula for modeled rainfall-runoff time series. Nevertheless, the poor performance of the model in simulating the spring peak flows due to snowmelt runoff, the model has been approved by traditional performance evaluation criteria. However fitting the observed and simulated rainfall-runoff time series with Clayton and Gaussian copulas with different tail dependencies indicated inability of the model to properly simulate stochastic relationship between rainfall and runoff. © 2018 Institute of Geophysics.

abstract={The assessment of peak flow rate, total runoff volume, and pollutant loads during rainfall process are very important for the watershed management and the ecological restoration of aquatic environment. Real-time measurements of rainfall-runoff and pollutant loads are always the most reliable approach but are difficult to carry out at all desired location in the watersheds considering the large consumption of material and financial resources. An integrated environmental modeling approach for the estimation of flash streamflow that combines the various hydrological and quality processes during rainstorms within the agricultural watersheds is essential to develop targeted management strategies for the endangered drinking water. This study applied the Hydrological Simulation Program—Fortran (HSPF) to simulate the spatial and temporal variation in hydrological processes and pollutant transport processes during rainstorm events in the Miyun Reservoir watershed, a drinking water resource area in Beijing. The model performance indicators ensured the acceptable applicability of the HSPF model to simulate flow and pollutant loads in the studied watershed and to establish a relationship between land use and the parameter values. The proportion of soil and land use was then identified as the influencing factors of the pollution intensities. The results indicated that the flush concentrations were much higher than those observed during normal flow periods and considerably exceeded the limits of Class III Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002) for the secondary protection zones of the drinking water resource in China. Agricultural land and leached cinnamon soils were identified as the key sources of sediment, nutrients, and fecal coliforms. Precipitation volume was identified as a driving factor that determined the amount of runoff and pollutant loads during rainfall processes. These results are useful to improve the streamflow predictions, provide useful information for the identification of highly polluted areas, and aid the development of integrated watershed management system in the drinking water resource area. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={River is one part of the hydrologic cycle. Water in rivers is generally collected from precipitation, such as rain, dew, springs, underground runoff, and in certain countries also comes from melt ice/snow. The height and speed of water in a river is always changing. Changes in altitude and speed of water can affect the surrounding environment. In this paper, we will design a system to measure the altitude and speed of the river. In this work we use Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors and flow rate sensors. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 is used as a river height meter. Based on the test results, this sensor has an accuracy of 96.6%. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Poland has been long harnessing hydraulic energy despite the absence of supportive conditions for hydropower development. According to the Energy Regulatory Office, there were 721 hydropower plants in Poland in 2014. Electric power generation in small and medium-sized hydropower plants is characterized by minor fluctuations, in particular in comparison with other sources of renewable energy. In a given period, the observed changes in power output result mainly from variations in operating conditions. Hydropower resources are determined by two factors: the slope of the riverbed and water flow rate. Poland is a lowland country with relatively low levels of precipitation and permeable soils, and these factors significantly limit the availability of hydropower resources. The study was conducted in a complex of 4 hydropower plants with the combined output of 3,762 MW, situated on the Lyna River in north-eastern Poland. The combined output of the examined hydropower plants, which operate a total of 8 hydroelectric generators, was examined over a 7-year period (2011-2017). In the analyzed hydropower plants, the highest average output was observed in the spring months with a peak of 256 MWh in March 2017 and an average of 187 MWh in 2007-2017. The minimum average monthly output below 120 MWh was noted in the summer months (June-September). The output of every hydropower plant was also analyzed individually in view of downtimes and outages. The hydroelectric generators in plant Braswald with the highest nominal ratings (16% and 18%), plant Lyna (11%), plant Kotowo (9% and 9%) had the highest share of energy production in the hydropower complex. The power generation capacity of every hydroelectric generator was also calculated. The hydroelectric generator in plant Braswald was characterized by the highest generation capacity of 66%, whereas plant Lyna was characterized by the lowest generation capacity of 47%. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

abstract={One of the primary objectives of river basin planning and management is to assess the behavior of the river towards man-made and natural changes. In recent times, the self-purifying capacity of the river is found to be substantially affected because of extensive use of water for agricultural and industrial purposes. Any variation in the flow regime of a river poses a severe impact on the aquatic ecosystem, which affects its self-purifying capacity. Diverting river water for industrial and agricultural uses through dams and barrages reduces the natural flow rate of the river. The present study develops a novel approach by coupling Watershed Modeling System (WMS ver. 10.1) with linear optimization to provide an alternate means of water supply for such users. To explain the effectiveness of the model, a case study on the Ganges river basin of India has been considered. The ecosystem of the Ganges provides such a magnificent biological fabric, that its self-purifying capacity exceeds that of any other river water across the globe. However, the industries found in the river’s most polluted stretch consume around 1200 million liters of water every day. In addition, 80% of the river water diverts at Narora barrage for agricultural purposes. As a result, the flow of the river in dry seasons is as less as 300 m3/s. The study suggests the need to develop economically feasible and efficient storage reservoirs to store the rainwater, which can be used to supply industrial and agricultural needs. The WMS software is used to acquire the watershed basin, outlet location, simulated runoff volume, proposed reservoir site, and the hydrograph using the monitored rainfall data of 5 years (2010–2014). The simulated runoff volume is then used to develop an optimization model to determine the required capacity of each reservoir using LINGO software (ver. 16.0). Four different storage reservoirs are proposed in the selected industrial sites of Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, India. These reservoirs can supply the needs of industries, and thus reducing their dependency on the river Ganges.

abstract={Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is an emerging tool for monitoring the spread of aquatic invasive species. One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hydrology is important for glacier dynamics, but it is difficult to monitor the subsurface drainage systems of glaciers by direct observations. Since meltwater drainage generates seismic signals, passive seismic analysis has the potential to be used to monitor these processes. To study continuous seismic radiation from the drainage, we analyze geophone data from six stations deployed at the Kaskawulsh Glacier in Yukon, Canada, during the summer of 2014 using ambient noise cross-correlation techniques. We locate the noise sources by backprojecting the amplitude of the cross correlation to the glacier surface. Most of the ambient noise sequences are found in two clusters, with each cluster located in the vicinity of a moulin identified at the surface. Stronger seismic radiation is observed during the day, consistent with expected variability in melt rates. We demonstrate that the sparse seismic network array with 2 km station separation has the ability to detect moulins within the array with a precision of 50 m. We confirm that seismic activity is correlated with air temperature, and thus, melt, on a diurnal timescale, and precipitation correlates with the activity at longer timescales. Our results highlight the potential of passive seismic observations for monitoring water flow into subglacial channels through moulins with an affordable number of seismic stations, but quantification of water flow rates still remains a challenge. The cross-correlation backprojection technique described here can also potentially be applied to any localized source of ambient noise such as ocean noise, tectonic tremor, and volcanic tremor. ©2017.

abstract={Based on the structures of impact sprinkler PY30, a gas suction pipe was inserted in the middle position of the sprinkler tube to form an aeration impact sprinkler. As the fixed and rotating impact sprinkler works at the low pressure, the gas-liquid two-phase jet spray could improve the hydraulic performance of the sprinkler. With the same flow rate at the working pressure of 100 kPa, 200 kPa and 300 kPa respectively, impact sprinklers with and without aeration were comparatively studied. Experiments were carried out to study the sprinkler hydraulic parameters affected by the gas-liquid jet and the variation of gas flow rate, including the water distribution in the radial direction, the ranges of jet. At the same time, the combination uniformity coefficient in different distance was calculated for square arrangement mode. The results show that at the same working pressure and flow rate, PY30 impact sprinkler and its aeration impact sprinkler had nearly the same jet range. With reference to the outlet of sprinkler nozzle, the gas suction pipe moved from-1.5 mm to 0 mm and 2.0 mm, the vacuum of gas suction pipe increased gradually and the amount of gas flow rate q became larger. In the meantime, the water distribution of the impact sprinkler was compared with that of the aeration impact sprinkler, the precipitation in the middle range of sprinkler water jet was enhanced gradually and the peak tended to the interval values. At the working pressure of 200 kPa and 300 kPa, the optimum combination distance of the aeration impact sprinkler is R and the combination uniformity coefficients of the sprinkler irrigation are 2.5% and 1.9% greater than those of the impact sprinkler. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Drainage and Irrigation Machinery Engineering.

abstract={Because of the problems with sludge formation and inability to meet water reuse standards with traditional limestone neutralization, nanofiltration (NF) has been evaluated for treatment of abandoned mine drainage (AMD). This study contributes to the process of selecting NF membranes based on laboratory-scale studies that is validated in pilot-scale system with real AMD under relevant process conditions to recover: (1) treated water stream (NF permeate) that can serve as a substitute for fresh water in industrial applications and (2) concentrated sulfate stream (NF reject) that is well-suited to control divalent cations in the produced water from unconventional gas extraction by sulfate precipitation and enable its reuse for hydraulic fracturing of subsequent wells. Eight commercially available NF membranes were tested with synthetic and real AMD in laboratory-scale dead-end and cross-flow membrane filtration modules. NF90 membrane was selected for pilot-scale study that consisted of aeration and sedimentation for iron control, bag filtration and ultrafiltration for particulate control and NF. The system was operated for 208 h using real AMD at 10 bar and 3.5 GPM feed flow rate and consistently achieved more than 98% removal of TDS at 57% water recovery with a nominal pressure drop of 1.7 bar. Pressure drop monitoring and water permeability tests post pilot-scale study along with chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that no fouling/scaling of the membranes occurred. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={As part of the project KURAS, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe realized a field campaign in 2015 in order to increase the process knowledge regarding the behaviour of transported sediment in the pressure main leading from the pumpstation to the wastewater treatment plant. The field campaign was conducted because of a lack of knowledge about the general condition of the pressure main due to its bad accessibility and the suspicion of deposits caused by hydraulic underload. The practical evidence of the sediment transport performance of this part of the sewer system, dependent on different load cases, should present a basis for further analysis, for example regarding flushing measures. A positive sideeffect of the investigation was the description of the amount of pollutants caused by different weather conditions in combined sewer systems and the alterations of the sewage composition due to biogenic processes during transport. The concept included the parallel sampling of the inflowat the pumpstation and the outflow at the end of the pressure main during different weather conditions. By calculating the inflow to the pressure main, as well as its outflow at different flow conditions, it was possible to draw conclusions in regard to the transport behaviour of sediment and the bioprocesses within an 8.5 km section of the pressure main. The results show clearly that the effects of sedimentation and remobilization depend on the flow conditions. The balance of the total suspended solids (TSS) load during daily variations in dryweather shows that the remobilization effect during the run-off peak is not able to compensate for the period of sedimentation happening during the low flow at night. Based on the data for dryweather, an average of 238 kg of TSS deposits in the pressure main remains per day. The remobilization of sediment occurs only due to the abruptly increased delivery rates caused by precipitation events. These high pollution loads lead to a sudden strain at the wastewater treatment plant. Itwas found that the sediment transport behaviour is characterized by sedimentation up to a flow velocity of 0.35 m/s,while remobilization effects occur above 0.5 m/s. The assumption of bad sediment transport performance in the pressure main was confirmed. Therefore, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis, for example regarding periodical flushing as a means of cleaning the pressure main. The findings, especially regarding the methods and processes, are transferable and can be applied to other pressure mains in combined sewer systems. Besides the outlined evaluation of the sediment transport behaviour of the pressure main, the collected data were used in the project to calibrate a sewer system model, including a water quality model for the catchment area, and as a contribution towards an early physically based sediment transport modelling in InfoWorks CS. © IWA Publishing 2017.},

abstract={Soil erosion with surface runoff in red soil hilly in tropical and subtropical zones of central China cause severe soil quality degradation and environmental issues. It is driven by both rainfall and runoff flow that usually take place simultaneously during an erosion event. The objectives of this study were to determine the main process of rill erosion evolution and explore the main erosion parameters that affected the erosion rate during the process. In order to simulate the erosion process, an indoor experiment including the experimental combination of 3 slopes (5°, 8°, 12°), 2 discharges (5, 7.5 L/min) and 2 rainfall conditions (no rain and 90 mm/h rainfall intensity) was carried out on a red soil flume (3-m length and 0.5-m wide and 0.4-m height). The slit clay soil passing through a 2-cm sieve was used for the experiment. Before the experiment, the bulk density and moisture for the soil sample was controlled at 1.35 g/cm3 and 30%, respectively. The staining method was utilized to measure the flow velocity; the runoff width could be measured through using a ruler at 3 positions; the sediment yield and flow rate were be deduced and calculated from the water bottle used for collecting the runoff samples at the bottom of the flume during a set time interval. A single trial persisted 50 min. The hydrodynamic parameters including shear stress, unit stream power and stream power were calculated. Results showed that: 1) The erosion of red soil slope had obvious periodic development. The initial phase of erosion processes was mainly based on the layer erosion before the first 3-min and then followed by rill erosion. Steep grade, high flow rate and rainfall condition could greatly accelerate the development of rill erosion process and largely increase the erosion rate. 2) The mean erosion rate of each erosion phase was followed by: initial phase&gt; rill development phase&gt; rill stabile phase. In general, the total sediment yield of each erosion phase was followed by: rill development phase&gt; initial phase&gt; rill stabile phase. The erosion in the rill development phase accounted for 38.43%-84.84% of the total sediment yield. The relationship between the hydraulic parameters and the erosion rate of initial phase was closer by stream power&gt; slope&gt; shear stress&gt; unit stream power = flow velocity &gt; flow rate. The mean erosion rate of rill development phase was extremely significant (P&lt;0.01) with stream power, and was significant (P&lt;0.05) with shear stress and slope, while the erosion rate of rill stable phase was just related to flow rate and slope. 3) Stream power was the optimal predictor to predict erosion rate for both layer erosion and rill erosion with a linear relationship. The critical stream power for the layer erosion, the rill erosion in the flow scouring test, and the rill erosion under the interaction of rainfall and scouring flow was 0.091, 0.121, -1.691 N/(m·s), and their corresponding erodibility was 19.95×10-3, 2.64×10-3, 3.59×10-3 s2/m2, respectively. The results are valuable for agricultural water-soil engineering and controlling soil loss of red soil, and also play a significant role in improving soil erosion models. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major crop on the Loess Plateau, and calculating the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) of maize is important for estimating field water balance. In this study, the sap flow method was adopted to measure transpiration (T) characteristics of maize. In order to calibrate the sap flow gauge, the sap flow rate was compared to the leaf T determined by the weighing method. The sap flow value was measured per hour for 3 days and the mean of the hourly values for each day was taken as the daily value to avoid the influence of hydraulic capacitance. There was a significant linear relationship between leaf T and sap flow rate. The slope and intercept of linear regression were 0.764 and 4.944, with an R2 of 0.97 (p&lt;0.01). We also analyzed the T and ET of maize under field conditions. The T/ET of maize was 63.3% from July to September 2012. The T/ ET and leaf area index had a good linear relationship. Partitioning of ET into soil evaporation (E) and T may have important implications for analyzing crop water use efficiency, evaluating the crop production potential of precipitation and optimizing field water management. © IWA Publishing 2017.},

abstract={In a joint research project of the Zittau/Goerlitz University of Applied Sciences (HSZG), the Technische Universitaet Dresden (TUD) and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), the main emphasis is the time-related assignment of simultaneous and interacting mechanisms at zinc sources and zinc sinks at boundary conditions of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in German pressurized water reactors (PWR). The according experiments are carried out at semi-technical and at laboratory scale. Zinc is used as a protective coating, e.g. for gratings in the containment, showing high corrosion resistance due to a gradual formation of passivating layers. In contrast, its long-term behaviour during LOCA changes significantly under the influence of the coolant chemistry of German PWR. As a consequence, according installations in the containment act as zinc sources. Released zinc ions change the chemical properties of the coolant and could e.g. lead to layer-forming depositions of zinc borates in the core, which increase the possibility of a hindered heat dissipation. For experimental and methodical investigations of these phenomena, the test rig “Zittau Flow Tray” (ZFT), a scaled sump model of a German PWR, was equipped with a full-length 3×3 fuel assembly (FA) dummy acting as core model, a preheater and a cooler component. Nine 4.4 m long fuel rod dummies simulate the decay heat by internal heating cartridges. This rig design enables experimental investigation of physico-chemical mechanisms considering coolant containing boric acid and zinc and their influence on the thermo-hydraulic processes in the reactor core at post-LOCA boundary conditions. The time depending zinc release at hot-dip galvanized gratings (HGG) was investigated regarding their position (e.g. inside or near the leaking jet, freely suspended or submerged in the coolant) and their surface area as well as temperature and flow rate of the coolant. The experimental database allows the approximation of corrosion rates in dependence of HGG position and the accident-specific coolant leakage rate as well as first mathematical approaches for the modelling of zinc sources. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery Inc.

abstract={Sewerage system operation modeling is rarely applied in Poland, mainly due to lack of necessary input databases as well as methodological basis still under development. In the paper, land drainage mathematical modeling using SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) software was revised, based on the example of stormwater catchment and its drainage system for the city of Wroclaw. Research pilot catchment selection criteria were developed as well as principles of local database creation for rainfall events and wastewater stream measurements from sewage collectors over a minimum 2-year period. New rules of hydrological and hydraulic parameter identification were proposed for hydrodynamic models during their calibration and validation, taking into account rainfalls for sewage system sizing and overload verification. Statistical criteria were proposed for model quality evaluation, usually employed to compare simulation results of the stormwater runoff flow rate (Q) and runoff volume (V) for the effective precipitation with the measurement data. The methodical aspect of the results presented is of a universal nature. Thus the results can be applied for identification, calibration and validation of hydrodynamic precipitation-runoff models (also outside Wroclaw). It was proposed that parameter identification of hydrological and hydraulic models of stormwater catchments with drainage systems performed using the SWMM software took into account spatiotemporal changes in rainfall intensity (e.g. using Surfer software).},

abstract={Electro-concentration enables treatment and nutrient recovery from source-separated urine, and is a potential technology for on-site treatment using a 3 compartment configuration that has anode, cathode and middle concentrate compartments. There is a particular focus on driving concentration towards the precipitation threshold in the concentrate compartment to generate solid ammonium salts, including ammonium bicarbonate. To evaluate controlling mechanisms and the feasibility of achieving high concentrations, a dynamic mechanistic model was developed and validated using experiments with synthetic urine. It was identified that high concentrations are prevented by increased back diffusion (diffusion from the middle chamber to the anolyte and catholyte) due to large concentration gradients, and the preferential migration of protons or hydroxide ions due to a loss of buffering capacity in the anolyte and catholyte (due to pH extremes). Model-based sensitivity analysis also identified that electrolyte ion concentrations (including buffer capacity) were the main controlling mechanisms, rather than membrane or electrolyte current transfer capacity. To attain high concentrations, operation should be done using a) a high current density (however there is a maximum efficient current density); b) feed at short hydraulic retention time to ensure sufficient buffer capacity; and c) a feed high in ammonium and carbonate, not diluted, and not contaminated with other salts, such as pure ureolysed urine. Taking into account electron supply and bio-anodic buffer limitations, model testing shows at least double the aqueous concentrations observed in the experiments may be achieved by optimising simple process and operational parameters such as flow rate, current density and feed solution composition. Removal of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) and total carbonate carbon (TCC) was between 43–57% and 39–53%, respectively. Balancing the sometimes conflicting process goals of high concentrations and removal percentage will need to be considered in further application. Future experimental work should be directed towards developing electrodes capable of higher current densities. In addition it would be desirable to use ion exchange membranes with higher resistance to water fluxes and which limit back diffusion. Future modelling work should describe osmotic and electro-osmotic water fluxes as a function of the concentration gradient across the membranes and ionic fluxes, respectively. More generalised wastewater physico-chemistry speciation models should identify best methods where relatively simple Davies activity corrections do not apply. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper combines hydrological and flood models for the purpose of estimating surface and peak flow rates from precipitation storm events occurred in basins of Rize province located in northern Turkey, receiving highest annual average precipitation height over 2300 mm. Two models: (i) Watershed Modeling System for predicting hydrographs and (ii) TuFlow comprised of hydrodynamic model of a one-dimensional river flow and a two-dimensional surface flow model for floodplain delineation were coupled to determine flood risks in the basins of Rize province. A 100-year flood peak discharges are computed based on the historical records and generated records in relation to climate change scenarios using grid-based approach. The influences of resolution of the mesh-size with the same DEM data on automated floodplain delineation are also another concern to investigate in this study. The results of this study could be used in quantitative flood risk assessments in the design of municipal infrastructures in the region. The results of this study showed that İyidere River flooded during the both present and future (tied with three climate change scenarios) conditions and seemed to need rehabilitation whereas Çağlayan and Tahiroğlu rivers flooded only in present condition. Our investigation also showed that coarse grid resolutions might cause overestimation in the floodplain and water depth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The extreme variation in the amount of annual precipitation and rainfall during single events is typical of the East Asian monsoon climate and may greatly influence the characteristics of the suspended sediment load. The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly suspended sediment loads and the ratio of maximum suspended sediment loads in a single event to yearly suspended sediment load from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009-2010 events, and simulation results characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001-2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4-6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly suspended sediment load and a significant of amount of suspended sediment load during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly suspended sediment load was 10 times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly suspended sediment load was loaded with a single event under the Asian summer monsoon climate and the ratio of suspended sediment loads by a single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29% to 90%. Structural best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas, which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region. © 2017 by the authors.},
